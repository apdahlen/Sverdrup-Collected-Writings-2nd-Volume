STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Enhed" – not mere organizational unity but spiritual, ontological unity in Christ.
* "Kristenkhed" – Christendom as the whole Christian world, not simply the Church as institution.
* "Forstand" vs. "Sans" – human reason vs. spiritual perception; must preserve Pauline contrast.
* "Kjødelig" / "aandelige" – fleshly vs. spiritual in Pauline-theological sense.
* "Vantro" – unbelief, not mere doubt.
* "Anstød" – stumbling blocks / offenses in a biblical sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with concessive openings and sermonic pivots.
* Parallel negations ("ikke … ikke heller …").
* Colon and semicolon logic must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Unity as fruit of faith, not human organization.
* Distinction between visible arrangements and invisible spiritual reality.
* Pauline anthropology (flesh vs. spirit).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, corrective, pastoral tone.
* Must not soften rebuke of human reason and unbelief.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "ligger oppe i Dagen" – lies open to view; self-evident to natural perception.
* "kjødelig Sind" – fleshly mind (Rom. 8).
* "aandelige Ting" – spiritual things (1 Cor. 2).
* "Blodets Baand" – bonds of blood; metaphor for natural human unity.

KJV-style equivalents are natural and should be used ("fleshly mind," "spiritual things," "bonds").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Thesis: From human reason, unity of believers appears impossible.
2. Concession: Human arguments seem convincing.
3. Rebuttal: The matter is spiritual, not fleshly.
4. Assertion: Spiritual understanding of unity removes scandals.
5. Clarification: Unity is not created by meetings or organization.
6. Core claim: Unity already exists through faith itself.
7. Analogy: As humanity is one by blood, believers are one by stronger bonds.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 3:26, 28 (explicit quotations).
* 1 Corinthians 2 (spiritual vs. natural man).
* Romans 8 (flesh vs. spirit).
* Ephesians 4 implicit unity-of-the-body theology.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness against rationalism.
* Preserve pastoral concern for scandal and stumbling.
* Retain confident doctrinal assertions.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan" / "maa" implications preserved as necessity and impossibility.
* Assertions stated without hedging.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Enhed – unity
* Tro – faith
* Aandelig – spiritual
* Kjødelig – fleshly
* Kristenkhed – Christendom

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Blood-bond metaphor retained.
* Do not explain away figurative language.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From despairing human outlook to confident spiritual assertion.
* Warning → consolation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where intentional.
* Parallelism preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

4. The Unity of the Believers

[Source: “Luthersk Tidsskrift,” 1907, pp. 65–74. See the note above, p. 344. — Ed.]

“Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.” Gal. 3:26.

“Ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” Gal. 3:28.

When we, with our human understanding, look out over the divided and torn Christendom, it appears senseless and hopeless to speak of the unity of the believers. It does not seem to be present; nor is there any prospect of ever attaining it here upon earth. It would be a superfluous waste of time here to enumerate the manifold proofs for this opinion of human reason and unbelief concerning the matter. We have heard them so often already, and they lie openly before our natural perception.

But thereby the matter is not settled; for here there is no question of a fleshly matter, which can be judged by a fleshly mind. Here spiritual perception is required, which discerns spiritual things. And this is certain: that if the believers come to a clear spiritual recognition of this chief matter in Christianity, much will thereby be accomplished toward removing the stumbling blocks which disagreement and division within Christendom occasion for many.

The unity of the believers is not brought about by the believers’ assembling at some place or other and resolving to be in agreement, or to organize an outward society, or by any other outward endeavor.

The unity of the believers is brought forth by faith itself. Before meetings and agreements, before constitutions and resolutions, the unity of the believers is already present in and through their faith. Just as the human race is one by the “bonds of blood,” so the believers are bound together into a unity by nobler and finer, and therefore also more inward and stronger, bonds.
