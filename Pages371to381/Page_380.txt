STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Saar" (wound): metaphorical and bodily; must retain sensitivity imagery.
* "Vildfarelser" and "Feiltrin": doctrinal error and moral misstep; not mere mistakes.
* "Renheden": spiritual/moral purity, not hygienic.
* "Sind": disposition or heart-mind, not emotion alone.
* "Samfundslivet": communion-life or shared life, ecclesial fellowship.
* "Omhyggelighed": earnest, loving care, not anxious fussiness.
* "Opgaver": divinely entrusted tasks/commission.
* "Trang og Drift": inward necessity and impulse.
* "Art": essential nature or character.
* "Endrægtig": of one accord, harmonious in will.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal logic.
* Embedded biblical quotations woven into prose.
* Parallel constructions emphasizing unity.
* Sermonic cadence requiring retention of length and rhythm.

Theological Hazards:

* Brotherhood and guardianship (Cain imagery).
* Preservation from error as salvific in effect.
* Unity of believers as work of the Spirit.
* Mission to the nations rooted in Abrahamic promise.
* Trinitarian confession.
* Diversity of gifts within one Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone.
* Direct address to conscience.
* Warning against narrow-hearted judgment.
* Pastoral urgency without sentimentality.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sin Broders Vogter": Allusion to Genesis 4; moral responsibility for fellow believers.
* "frelser en Sjæl fra Døden": Echo of James 5:20.
* "skjuler Synders Mangfoldighed": 1 Peter 4:8 resonance.
* "med ett Hjerte og én Tunge": Romans 15:6.
* "Lysets og Livets Rige": Johannine kingdom imagery.
* "alt Kjød skal se Guds Frelse": Luke 3:6 / Isaiah 40:5.

Literal translation would weaken force unless rendered in biblically resonant English.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Analogy: bodily sensitivity to wounds → spiritual vigilance.
* Moral claim: believers must guard one another.
* Definition: unity expressed through mutual care.
* Extension: unity also expressed in mission.
* Clarification: unity does not negate diversity.
* Warning: against narrow judgment.
* Exhortation: make room for the Spirit.
* Eschatological conclusion: preparation for the coming kingdom.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 4 (Cain).
* James 5:19–20.
* 1 Peter 4:8.
* Romans 15:6.
* 1 Corinthians 12:15–17.
* Luke 3:6 / Isaiah 40:5.

KJV diction will be used where possible.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings retained without softening.
* Exhortations remain direct and earnest.
* No modern paraphrase or emotional dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity (“cannot be otherwise”).
* Moral impossibility (“is impossible to unite with”).
* Exhortative imperatives (“let us beware,” “let us give room”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Enhed → unity
* Aand → Spirit
* Rige → kingdom
* Frelse → salvation
* Samfund → fellowship/communion

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body/wound metaphor retained.
* Flowing life through diversity preserved.
* Father’s heart imagery maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning → consolation → exhortation.
* Severity balanced with hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Clause rhythm maintained for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The smallest wound is perceptible in a body so finely sensitive, and at once there arises an effort to have the wound healed. It therefore cannot be otherwise than that errors and missteps which threaten the truth or the purity are sought corrected as soon as may be. To have Cain’s evil mind, which would not be his brother’s keeper, is impossible to unite with the unity of the believers or with the Spirit of God. In a good and true sense every believer is his brother’s keeper; for he who preserves his brother from error and fall preserves him in the life of fellowship with Jesus, and he who turns a brother from the error of his way saves a soul from death and hides a multitude of sins.

Therefore the unity of the believers is marked by their inward and heartfelt care for one another in all things. Great or small makes no difference; the living interest they have in one another is of divine origin, and the measure of their concern is not reckoned by a human standard.

And no different is it with the tasks of the kingdom of God, which have been entrusted to His congregation to fulfill. The kingdom of the Son of Man has within itself a divine necessity and impulse to embrace all peoples and to make them all partakers of the blessing which was promised to Abraham and to his seed. The unity of the believers shows itself herein, that they all share this nature, that they seek the salvation of the lost, whether the unredeemed are near at hand or far away. At home and abroad the unity of the believers is visible and recognizable by this zeal for the salvation of souls, this struggle for the kingdom of light and of life upon the earth. With one heart and with one tongue the fellowship of believers praises God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—for salvation, and confesses faith in the Triune God. With one heart and with one strength they labor for the same great cause of the kingdom: the proclamation of the Gospel to all nations.

Yet by this it is not said that they are not also many and do not rejoice heartily in becoming more. It has rightly been said that God is the God of diversity and takes delight in diversity. His creation is manifold, and yet the same mighty life pulses through the whole of it. His believers are manifold and endowed with manifold gifts; yet they are all permeated by the same Spirit and the same spiritual life. Let us therefore beware of becoming narrow in our hearts and in our judgments, so that we condemn as dead those whom the Lord nevertheless acknowledges, because they do not appear exactly as we think they ought. We remember the Apostle’s exhortation in 1 Corinthians 12:15–17, and this exhortation is not superfluous in our own day. Enlarged hearts are needed among God’s children, that they may be so much the more like Him with the great Father-heart, who has spared nothing and spares nothing in order to draw all into the embrace of love.

Therefore, brothers and sisters in the Lord, let us give the Spirit room in our hearts—ever greater room—so that the Father and the Son may come in to us and dwell and abide with us, so that, united with the Triune God and with one another, we may become a harmonious power in the world of sin and death, to practice the work of faith and love, and thus prepare the way for the kingdom that is coming, that all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
