STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kjød og Blod" – biblical idiom (Matt. 16:17), not merely physical flesh but fallen human nature.
* "Angers Taarer" – penitential sorrow, not mere regret.
* "Fortjeneste" – merit in a theological sense (Christ’s righteousness), not achievement.
* "den gamle Adam" – Pauline/Lutheran term for the fallen nature.
* "indpodet" – grafting metaphor (Rom. 11), sacramental and organic.
* "Kjortel" – garment imagery with biblical resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, paratactic sentences with semicolons and cumulative clauses.
* Rhetorical build‑ups that must not be broken into short modern sentences.
* Repeated infinitive constructions expressing cost and surrender.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance, forgiveness by unmerited grace, sanctification, union with Christ.
* Flesh vs. Spirit contrast.
* Justification by faith alone.
* Ecclesiology: unity of believers grounded in Christ, not externals.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran sermon tone.
* Strong address to conscience.
* Sharp contrast between pride of the old Adam and life in Christ.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "holde fast ved den usynlige, som om vi saa ham" – Heb. 11:27; faith as sight.
* "Naadens Dør" – imagery of begging grace, echoing Luke 18.
* "blodige Fodspor" – discipleship through suffering (1 Pet. 2:21).
* "Kjødets Død er Aandens Liv" – Pauline paradox (Rom. 8).
* Garment exchange – Zech. 3; Gal. 3:27.
* KJV diction suits these images naturally.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Direct encounter with Christ is painful to fallen nature but life‑giving.
* Development: Cost of repentance and faith to human pride.
* Doctrinal assertion: Death of flesh equals life of Spirit.
* Exaltation: Union with Christ surpasses all worldly glory.
* Exhortation: Therefore walk the direct and only way—Christ.
* Conclusion: True unity of believers exists only in continued attachment to Christ.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Foot of the Cross – Passion narratives.
* Faith as seeing the unseen – Heb. 11:1, 27.
* Following in bloody footsteps – 1 Pet. 2:21.
* Old Adam / new life – Rom. 5–6; Eph. 4.
* Light vs. darkness – John 1; Eph. 5.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against pride are retained without softening.
* Cost of discipleship expressed starkly.
* Consolation equally strong and elevated.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must".
* Exclusivity statements retained ("only", "no other").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Grace, faith, flesh, Spirit, old Adam, merit, life consistently rendered.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Grafting, garments, footsteps, chains of unity preserved intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity → consolation → exhortation → ecclesial hope maintained.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved with semicolons and rhythmic balance.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The direct encounter with the Savior is hard for flesh and blood, when we are made to stand at the foot of the Cross as poor sinners, who with tears of repentance must confess our sin and receive forgiveness of unmerited grace. And then thereafter to live and walk in faith, so that we hold fast to the Invisible as though we saw Him—this often falls so hard upon us. To surrender oneself and one’s own honor and rest solely upon Jesus and His merit; to renounce one’s own will and follow Jesus in the bloody footsteps; to lose the pleasant feeling that we are benefactors of the congregation by joining ourselves to it and supporting it, and in return must feel that we are poor beggars at the door of grace—yes, this is indeed heavy for the great, proud, vain old Adam. Yes, it truly is so; yet the death of the flesh is the life of the Spirit, and to be cut off from the old, sin‑defiled race and grafted into the pure, holy Jesus, and to have one’s life from Him and in Him, this is in truth a greater honor than all the glory of the world. To cast off the old, unclean, defiled garment and put on the Lord Jesus—what would not an earnest soul give for such an exchange! Mortal indeed it is to be rid of the false sheen and the useless self‑deception, and to come to the genuine, unadulterated being that accompanies living faith in Jesus—what is it not worth!

Let us therefore walk this direct way! It is not only the foremost; it is the only one; no other leads to the goal, which is the blessed life of the soul in time and in eternity. If we go in faith to Jesus and lay hold of Him as He is, then we have in Him the Reconciler, the Teacher, and the King. We are reconciled with the Father and filled with His love; we learn to walk the narrow way of life and to conduct ourselves in love; we receive a Head and a Lord who leads us with the tenderest love and grants us the most honorable calling that can be bestowed upon a human being—to wage the battle of light against darkness and to labor for the restoration of a fallen race to the glory of God. And in this way, and in this way only, do we attain a unity among believers that is not dependent upon outward things, nor broken by faults and frailties, offenses and scandals among the faithful. So long as they yet cling to Jesus, the unity is there; and only the one who falls away from the Lord comes out of that chain which binds the friends of Jesus together.
