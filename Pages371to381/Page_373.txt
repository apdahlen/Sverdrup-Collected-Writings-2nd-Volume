STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Profet" used not merely as office but as spiritually inspired speaker.
* "Kis til Fader" alludes to Saul son of Kish (1 Sam. 9), culturally opaque.
* "Naadens Barn" vs. "Syndens Barn" carry Pauline, doctrinal weight.
* "Barnekår" denotes filial adoption/status, not childhood sentiment.
* "sande Mennesker" implies restored imago Dei, not mere authenticity.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, multi-clause sentences with explanatory apposition.
* Parenthetical clarifications that must remain integrated.
* Sermonic cadence with contrasts and pivots marked by semicolons and dashes.

Theological Hazards:

* New birth (regeneration) vs. natural birth.
* Adoption as children of God.
* Distinction between old creation (Adam) and new creation (in Christ).
* Humanity restored in Christ as true humanity.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, earnest Lutheran tone.
* Warning against pride in election.
* Pastoral insistence on love, compassion, and mission.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "ogsaa en Saul er blandt Profeterne" – idiom from 1 Samuel 10:11; denotes unexpected divine transformation.
* "fordærvet Syndens Barn" – Pauline idiom (Eph. 2), child of wrath/sin.
* "Abrahams Børn ved Troen" – Galatians 3 echo.
* "Faderhjemmet" – Luke 15 (Prodigal Son) imagery.
* "Barnekårets Aand" – Romans 8 (Spirit of adoption).
  KJV diction naturally suits these expressions.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: True prophetic authority depends on divine, not natural, fatherhood.
* Doctrinal assertion: New birth transforms sinners into children of grace.
* Scriptural grounding: Malachi on one Father—interpreted as new creation.
* Anthropological claim: God’s children are the true humans (imago Dei restored).
* Ethical implication: Adoption produces humility, love, and mission.
* Illustrative example: Peter and Cornelius (Acts 10).
* Concluding exhortation: God’s children are called to restore fallen humanity.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 10:11 – Saul among the prophets.
* Malachi 2:10 – One Father, one Creator.
* Genesis/Adam vs. Abraham typology.
* Romans 8 – Spirit of adoption.
* Acts 10:25–26 – Peter and Cornelius.
* Luke 15 – Prodigal son imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain firm contrasts between nature and grace.
* Preserve admonition against pride.
* Maintain pastoral urgency and missionary zeal.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity in phrases like "det kommer an paa" rendered with force.
* Vocational calling ("maa søge") preserved as obligation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Barnekår" = adoption/filial status.
* "Naade" = grace.
* "Aand" = Spirit.
* "Menneskeværdighed" = true human dignity.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Birth imagery (natural vs. divine) retained.
* Family, lineage, and home metaphors preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward sin.
* Consolation in grace.
* Hopeful missionary outlook.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Balanced clauses and parallelism preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Could it be said in a more arresting way that for a prophet it does not depend on whether he has Kish for his father? What matters is to have God for one’s Father. He who is born of God speaks by the Spirit of God; and at all times and in all places it is a miracle of God when “even a Saul is among the prophets,” that is, when one who according to his natural birth is nothing but a corrupted child of sin, by being born of God has become a child of grace, who is driven by the Spirit of God, his Father, in word and in deed.

“We have not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?” says the prophet Malachi. And he does not speak of the first creation, according to which we are all children of Adam; but he speaks of the new creation, by which God creates new men, the true children of Abraham through faith.

This new race of God’s children are the true men. For the filial status with God does not lift believers up into a new superhuman dignity, so that they may look down upon other men with contempt; no, it lifts them precisely into true human dignity, so that they again become what men were created to be—the image of God. Far from making them proud and arrogant, insensitive and egoistic, the Spirit of adoption fills them with the love of God; and as they themselves have begun to understand how great a thing it is to be true men, it becomes their highest delight and the longing of their hearts to lead others forward into the same joy and glory which they themselves have experienced.

Only see what is written of this in Acts 10:25–26: “And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.” It is not a matter of crushing down, but of raising up, that concerns Peter. So far from boasting that he was more than Cornelius because he was a Jew and a believer, he precisely lays aside the Jewish boast, because in Christ he was a true man, a child of the heavenly Father.

This new race of God’s children thus bears within its very adoption this calling and this impulse, that it must seek to raise up all fallen men and gather them into that fellowship and kinship of God into which it itself has entered. Love, compassion, mercy are therefore the words that designate its relation to men, because they are all created by the same God and all by nature are the same Father’s lost sons and daughters, whom it concerns us to call back to the Father’s house.
