STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Slægt" / "Slægtled" – carries both genealogical and spiritual lineage meanings.
* "Redskaber" – not mere tools, but divinely used instruments in salvation history.
* "Samfund" – communion or fellowship, not simply social interaction.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with theological pivots.
* Frequent semicolon logic that must be preserved.
* Rhetorical contrasts between old and new lineage.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of divine fatherhood.
* Unity of believers across time, space, and confessions.
* Instrumentality versus means of grace.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, sermonic exhortation.
* Polemic against sectarianism without doctrinal laxity.
* Biblical cadence must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Blodets Baand" – bonds of blood; echoes biblical kinship language.
* "Slægtregister" – genealogical register; echoes biblical genealogies.
* Matthew 23:9 implicit quotation regarding one Father in heaven.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Contrast between natural and spiritual lineage.
* Assertion of superior unity among God’s children.
* Refutation of divisions based on nation or confession.
* Pastoral warning against idolizing instruments of salvation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 23:9 – one Father in heaven.
* Ephesians imagery of unity in one Spirit.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain polemical firmness against sectarian pride.
* Preserve exhortational warmth toward unity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan ikke" rendered as strong necessity or impossibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Father = Fader
* Children of God = God’s children
* Unity = unity / oneness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Genealogy shortened to Father and child.
* Journey imagery toward the Father’s heart.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning against division balanced with consolation of unity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic contrasts.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

In this, that they are children of one Father, the new race is nevertheless far—far in advance of the old. For in the old race the mutual kinship does indeed become more and more distant as time goes on and the number of generations increases. True as it is that we are bound together by “the ties of blood,” we nevertheless know both from the history of the family and from daily experience that it is only the very nearest relatives who have any awareness of this bond; and it is not long before even those who belong to the same people stand as strangers over against one another.

But it is not so with the children of God. At all times they are, in the strictest sense, one another’s brethren. Here neither family nor people, tribe nor race, land nor continent makes any difference. If we meet a Christian man or woman from Europe or Asia, Africa or Australia, at once the Christian brotherhood is there; for we have indeed one and the same Father, Him who is in the heavens. The believers’ register of descent is so short: it is only child and Father—and then no more. For Jesus says: Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, He who is in the heavens.

Thus neither time nor place can abolish this unity of the believers, that they have one Father. Not even the circumstance that they have been led home to the Father in heaven by different instruments ought to make any breach in this honor and joy of the believers. It is perhaps here most often that something intrudes which would disturb the unity. But whether we are Lutherans or Wesleyans or Zwinglians or Calvinists, we nevertheless have only one Father, He who is in the heavens—if indeed we truly are God’s children. Not that it is right to despise the instruments which God has used for our salvation; but neither is it right to set these instruments in the way of our fellowship with God and God’s children. They help us on the way; they do not hinder us from arriving, if only the journey proceeds rightly. And if we arrive at the Father’s heart by the one Mediator Jesus Christ, and by the one Spirit become the one and the same Father’s children, then the difference which exists between the various divisions of the Church will not be able to make the children strangers to one another.
