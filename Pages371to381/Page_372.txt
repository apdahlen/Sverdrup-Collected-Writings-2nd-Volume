STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Lignelse” here functions broadly as an illustrative comparison or typological analogy, not merely a parable in the synoptic sense.
* “berettiget” carries the sense of being theologically warranted or justified, not merely permissible.
* “Slægt” denotes lineage, race, or spiritual family; its theological freight must be preserved consistently.
* “Opreisning” suggests raising up/restoration after a fall, with resurrection overtones.
* “Fordervelse” conveys moral and spiritual corruption, not simple decay.
* “Opbyggelse” is edification in the Pauline sense, not general encouragement.
* “Kjendsgjerning” implies an established, objective fact.
* “Særkjende” indicates a defining distinguishing mark.
* “Udvælgelsen” refers to election in a Lutheran-pietistic theological sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered causal clauses must be retained without fragmentation.
* The sermonic progression—assertion, implication, exhortation—depends on sentence flow.
* Embedded Scripture citations must remain syntactically integrated, not isolated.

Theological Hazards:

* The doctrine of divine fatherhood, new birth, election, unity of believers, and restoration from the Fall must remain precise.
* The relationship between old humanity and the “new race” must not be moralized or abstracted.
* Election must be presented relationally (God–child), not as an abstract decree.

Voice Hazards:

* The earnest, didactic, pastoral tone must not be softened.
* The author’s confidence in doctrinal realities must not be reduced to suggestion.
* Rhetorical emphasis (“Den samme Fader.”) must be preserved in force and placement.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “af ett Blod” echoes Acts 17:26; it denotes common origin under God’s creative act.
* “født af Gud” is Johannine (John 1:13; 1 John), requiring KJV-style resonance (“born of God”).
* “én Aand og ett Liv” reflects Pauline unity language (Eph. 4), not mere harmony.
* “Slægtens Opreisning af Faldet” draws on Romans 5 theology of fall and restoration.
* “Udvælgelsens Herlighed” should echo biblical “glory,” not prestige.
* “Hvem er da deres Fader?” functions proverbially, indicating common origin as the mark of true belonging.

Literal translation risks:

* Rendering “Slægt” as “generation” would obscure lineage theology.
* Flattening “Opbyggelse” to “instruction” would weaken pastoral intent.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The analogy of a unified human and spiritual lineage is theologically justified by God’s creative and redemptive acts.
* Doctrinal foundation: One God created all humanity; the same God creates unity among believers.
* Definition: The “new race” is the restoration and salvation of the old fallen race.
* Focused claim: The unity of the new race is grounded first in having one Father.
* Pastoral exhortation: Consciousness of divine sonship strengthens faith and love.
* Doctrinal clarification: Being born of God is the chief mark of the elect race.
* Scriptural illustration: Saul among the prophets demonstrates unity through shared fatherhood.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 17:26 — “made of one blood all nations of men.”
* Johannine new birth theology — John 1; 1 John.
* Pauline unity — one Spirit, one life (Eph. 4).
* 1 Samuel 10:10–12 quoted explicitly; language should align with KJV cadence.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Assertions must remain declarative and confident.
* Pastoral exhortations must retain urgency and earnestness.
* No mitigation of claims about faith, love, and divine fatherhood.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “kan ikke lægges for megen Vegt” must remain an absolute negation (“cannot be too strongly emphasized”).
* Conditional constructions (“Naar … saa”) must retain their causal force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Slægt → race / lineage (consistent throughout).
* Fader → Father (capitalized when divine).
* Aand → Spirit.
* Udvælgelse → election.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Restoration from the Fall must remain metaphorical and theological.
* Familial imagery (Father, children, brothers) must not be abstracted.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Doctrinal exposition → pastoral exhortation → illustrative narrative.
* Maintain transitions without smoothing emotional contours.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences suitable for proclamation.
* Retain emphatic sentence fragments (“The same Father.”).

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It goes without saying that this analogy is justified; for it is God who “hath made of one blood all the race of mankind to dwell upon the whole compass of the earth.” And it is the same God who has made it so that the believers have one Spirit and one life everywhere they are found. The new race is the raising up of the old race from the Fall, and its salvation from sin and from its inherent corruption.

When, therefore, for our edification, we would contemplate the unity of the new race, there meets us first and foremost this established fact: that all who belong to the new race have one Father.

The same Father.

There cannot be too much weight laid upon this matter. If it stands at all times a living reality before the consciousness of believers that they are “born of God,” then they become both firmer in faith and stronger in love; their fellowship with God and their love toward the brethren grow more intimate, the more clearly it stands before them that God is their Father.

It is the chief distinguishing mark of the “elect race” that it is a race born of God. This separates it from the world; this binds it together in the Spirit. It is precisely this which is the right and true glory of election, that it reveals itself in the relation to God and in kinship with Him.

There is a brief narrative in the First Book of Samuel which perhaps has not received from all the attention it ought to have. It stands in chapter 10, verses 10–12:

“And when they came thither to Gibeah, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? And one of the same place answered and said, And who, then, is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?”
