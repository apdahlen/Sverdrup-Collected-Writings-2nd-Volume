STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "salig" — carries strong soteriological meaning (blessed/saved), not merely "happy".
* "Forsoner" — atoner/reconciler with sacrificial and substitutionary force.
* "Midler" — mediator in the strict theological sense.
* "Menigheden" — the Church as the body of Christ, not a local congregation only.
* "Aandens Gjerning" — the work/operation of the Holy Spirit, doctrinally loaded.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, sermonic sentences with chained clauses and semicolon logic.
* Parenthetical biblical explanations embedded in argument flow.
* Rhetorical intensification through repetition (e.g., "Uden Jesus … uden Jesus …").

Theological Hazards:

* Unity in Father and Son (Johannine theology) must not be reduced to moral agreement.
* Justification by faith alone must remain explicit and uncompromised.
* Christ as exclusive way to the Father and source of the Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Doctrinal gravity must not be softened by modern idiom.
* Biblical cadence must be preserved.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gjøre Syndere salige" — echoes Luke 19:10; salvation, not moral improvement.
* "Sjæleangstens Spørgsmaal" — existential conviction of sin; Acts 16:30.
* "Tro paa den Herre Jesus" — direct echo of Acts 16:31 (KJV wording preferred).
* "gjør døde levende" — Ephesians 2; spiritual resurrection.
* "udgik fra Faderen … gik til Faderen" — John 16–17 Christological language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Clarification: difference acknowledged but set aside.
* Thesis: all true believers are united because they share one Father.
* Expansion: unity is also in the Son, since there is one Savior.
* Center: Christianity defined as faith in Christ alone.
* Soteriological argument: faith as the sole answer to salvation anxiety.
* Ecclesiological conclusion: believers are one person in Christ, He the Head.
* Mystical union: believers’ union with Christ mirrors Christ’s union with the Father.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 16:31 — "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."
* John 14:6 — no access to the Father except through Christ.
* John 17:20–23 — unity in Father and Son.
* Galatians 3:28 — "ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
* Ephesians 1; Colossians 1 — Christ as Head of the body.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against any salvation apart from Christ remain absolute.
* Faith presented as total surrender, not intellectual assent.
* No softening of exclusivity or urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" rendered as "cannot" or "there is no".
* "maa" rendered as "must".
* Necessity and impossibility retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Tro" → faith
* "salig" → saved / salvation (contextual)
* "Forsoner" → Reconciler / Atoner
* "Midler" → Mediator
* "Menigheden" → the Church

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Head and body imagery retained.
* Life/death transformation imagery preserved.
* Grasping Christ alone kept vivid.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Doctrinal exposition → existential appeal → mystical union.
* Consolation follows severity without dilution.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Parallelism and repetition maintained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It is therefore not said that the difference is without significance; but of that we shall not speak here. Only this must here be emphasized with the utmost strength: that all true believers are bound together into a living unity, since they all are of one Father.

But we cannot stop there in our contemplation. The Word of God and Christian experience show us that the unity of believers is not only in the Father, but also in His Son, inasmuch as they have only one Savior, Jesus Christ.

The same Savior.

Here is the center of Christianity; its true essence may in the briefest manner be designated as faith in Christ. It is precisely for this reason that our religion is called Christianity: that it revolves around Him who came into the world to make sinners saved. Therefore this also is the answer to the question of the soul’s anguish: What shall I do to be saved? “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.” For faith in Christ is not a cold philosophy that leaves a man in his misery; it is a way of salvation—yes, a salvation—that makes the dead alive, and that consists precisely in this one thing: to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Without Jesus there is for us no access to the Father; without Jesus there is for us no work of the Spirit. In the matter of our salvation everything rests upon Him who went forth from the Father and came into the world, who left the world again and went to the Father.

It therefore cannot be otherwise than that the unity of believers, in its innermost essence, is also unity in the faith of God’s Son—indeed, in God’s Son Himself, Jesus Christ. So intimate is the union of believers in Christ that it is not only said of them in John 17:20–23 that they shall be one in the Father and the Son, but in Galatians 3:28 it is said even more strongly: Ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Not merely one essence or one nature with the Father and the Son, but only one personhood, inasmuch as Jesus is the Head of His body, which is the Church.

For Jesus is our Mediator and Reconciler, and faith in this crucified Savior is such a surrender to Him that we let go of everything of our own—our will and cognition, our thought and feeling, our own sin and our own death—and lay hold of Him, Him alone, with all that He is and has, so that He becomes ours and we His for time and eternity. The believers’ union with Jesus is as intimate as Jesus’ union with the Father, as He Himself says: “that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee.”
