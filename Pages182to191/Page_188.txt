STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed: must be rendered as Church/Congregation with Pauline ecclesial sense, not merely a local meeting.
* Aanden: Spirit (Holy Spirit), capitalized; indwelling nuance.
* ustraffelig: blameless (KJV register), not merely "without reproach" in a social sense.
* Skrøbelighed: frailty/weakness with moral-spiritual sense.
* Midler: means (means of grace), technical Lutheran term.
* Sacramenter: Sacraments; retain ecclesial specificity.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long chained clauses with sermonic pacing; must not be broken down excessively.
* Parallelism (sent, worked, suffered) should be preserved.
* Rhetorical contrasts and ironic turns must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: Church as Christ’s Body, not institutional reduction.
* Faith arising from hearing (Rom. 10:17) and sustained thereby.
* Indwelling Spirit as constitutive of the Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, admonishing tone aimed at conscience.
* Irony regarding self-satisfied Christianity.
* Must not soften rebuke or doctrinal clarity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “fremstille sig selv en herlig Menighed” echoes Eph. 5:27; KJV phrasing is natural.
* “Plet eller Rynke” directly Pauline; retain literal imagery.
* “har holdt Budene fra Ungdommen af” echoes the rich young ruler (Matt. 19:20).
* Shoemaker metaphor: culturally vivid; preserve literal image.
* “aabenbaret for de umyndige” echoes Matt. 11:25.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* God’s sending (Son, Spirit) establishes divine intent for the Church.
* Apostolic suffering confirms its centrality.
* Irony: despite Scriptural clarity, self-deception obscures understanding.
* Rebuke of nominal Christianity.
* Doctrinal clarification: Church as Christ’s Body.
* Practical conclusion: Word and Sacraments sustain the Church’s life.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Eph. 5:25–27 (glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle).
* Rom. 10:17 (faith by hearing).
* Matt. 11:25 (revealed unto babes).
* 1 Cor. 12; Eph. 1 (Church as Christ’s Body).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Rebukes remain sharp.
* Irony is not softened.
* Doctrinal assertions remain absolute.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skulde” → “should” in theological necessity sense.
* Assertions of being/meaning are categorical.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → Church
* Aand → Spirit
* Tro → Faith
* Guds Ord → Word of God
* Sacramenter → Sacraments

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shoemaker metaphor retained verbatim in sense.
* Body imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Movement from proclamation to rebuke to instruction preserved.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intended.
* Semicolon-like pivots mirrored.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

God sent the Son, that He might present unto Himself a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.

God sent the Spirit to create the Church, that Christ’s suffering and resurrection might have their perfect fruit in her.

Christ’s Apostles labored and suffered for this cause, that there should be a Church of Christ in every place where the Gospel made its advance.

Therefore in the New Testament everything concerns the great mystery, which is Christ and the Church. And therefore it might seem that every child in Christendom ought to know what the Church is.

And it is simple enough, as is all God’s Gospel, if only we were not blinded in our unclean hearts and sinful thoughts.

It is the old story: we will not acknowledge our frailty; therefore we simply insist that we already are all that we ought to be, long since. We “have kept the commandments from our youth up”; we were good Christians before and have no need to become so; we are already Church, and require no change in that matter.

But if we are already Church, then it is incomprehensible what the Word of God means by Church. The one does not agree with the other; and since we will not correct ourselves according to God’s Word, then God’s Word must needs correct itself according to us; and we behave like poor cobblers who, when the shoe does not fit the foot, would make the foot fit the shoe.

How men have twisted and turned and distorted the Scripture and the theological conscience, to make fit together what does not fit!

These are deep matters and a great mystery, it is true; and yet it is “revealed unto babes.” The Church is the Body of Christ.

That this is a divine mystery revealed in the Gospel is altogether plain. And yet there is no Christian soul who does not understand that the Body of Christ is there, and only there, where the Spirit and life of Christ are.

This therefore means that the Church is a people of believing men, born of the Spirit of God, in order that the Spirit of God may also dwell in them.

But faith both comes from “hearing” and is sustained by it. The Word of God and the Sacraments are the means for the Church’s sustenance of life; therefore they are used in the Church by great and small alike.
