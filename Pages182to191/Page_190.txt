STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheden" – not merely a local congregation but the Church as a living body; must avoid reducing to institutional sense.
* "Kald" – vocation/calling with divine obligation, not mere invitation.
* "Formvæsen" – formalism, empty outward form; pietistic nuance.
* "Hykkeleri" – hypocrisy with moral-theological weight.
* "Saft og Kraft" – organic life-force imagery from viticulture.
* "Opstandelseskraft" – resurrection power; Pauline theology.
* "Færd og Optræden" – manner of life and public conduct.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological pivots.
* Rhetorical questions driving argument.
* Parallel metaphors (body / vine) that must remain aligned.

Theological Hazards:

* Union with Christ; crucifixion with Christ; life by resurrection power.
* Church as instrument of Christ’s continued revelation and action.
* Fruit-bearing as necessary consequence of life in Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Warning against clerical reductionism.
* Must not soften rebuke or moral seriousness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Legeme" – Pauline (1 Cor. 12; Eph. 1); KJV: “the body of Christ.”
* "Vintreet og Grenene" – John 15; KJV diction should guide.
* "korsfæstet med Kristus" – Gal. 2:20 echo.
* "leve i Kristi Opstandelseskraft" – Rom. 6 resonance.
* "vandre dette Kald værdigt" – Eph. 4:1 phrasing.
* "bære Frugt" – Johannine fruit imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church as Christ’s body reveals both Christ’s condescension and the Church’s exalted calling.
* Consequence: This calling imposes grave responsibility.
* First movement: Christ gives life to His body; mere outward membership is hypocrisy.
* Second movement: The body exists not only to live but to act and bear fruit.
* Application: The Church must reveal Christ and perform His works.
* Polemic: Critique of clergy who reduce this calling to institutional functions.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Body of Christ – 1 Corinthians 12.
* Vine and branches – John 15.
* Crucified with Christ – Galatians 2:20.
* Resurrection life – Romans 6.
* Walk worthy – Ephesians 4:1.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain seriousness and admonitory force.
* Preserve sharp contrasts between life and hypocrisy.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must."
* Necessity of fruit-bearing not optional.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden = the Church.
* Kald = calling.
* Aand og Liv = Spirit and life.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain body/soul and vine/branches imagery.
* Avoid explanatory dilution.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Move from exalted calling to stern warning.
* Preserve polemical edge in final paragraph.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain longer sentences and rhetorical pacing.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

THE BODY OF CHRIST

When the Church is the body of Christ, this shows both how infinitely condescending He is who is Lord of all, and at the same time how infinitely exalted is the calling wherewith the Church is called. It also lays the very greatest responsibility upon all who bear the Church’s holy name.

For what, then, does Christ will with His body? What does the vine will with its branches? What is it that is promised?

It says itself that Christ wills to give His body Spirit and life and blessedness and glory. It says itself that the vine wills to give its branches sap and strength. To be within the Church and not receive Spirit and life from Christ—that is formalism and hypocrisy. If anyone would be a true member of the Church, he must be crucified with Christ in order to live with Him. Dead to the world, living in the power of Christ’s resurrection—such is the right position within the Church.

Yet with this the matter is surely not finished. The soul dwells in the body in order that it may give itself to expression and be active through the body. The invisible and ascended Jesus lives in His Church in order still to be revealed and to work in the world. The branches upon the vine are not only to live; they are also to bear fruit.

From this we gain some insight into the Church’s high calling, and why it is so serious a matter to walk worthy of this calling.

The Church is to reveal Christ in the world, so that souls may see Him, know Him, believe Him, and live by Him. The Church is to do Christ’s works in the world, so that His love and mercy may be felt through the whole course and conduct of His Church. It is not merely a question of being a living branch, but of being a fruitful branch.

A number of people—especially pastors and theologians—so easily absolve themselves from this calling and responsibility. They say: yes, of course the Church reveals Christ in the world; that is why it has a pastor and the preaching of God’s Word and the administration of the sacraments. When the Church has these things, then its calling and task are fulfilled; and this costs so much per year, paid in ready money or in usable goods.
