README.md SUMMARY — DO YOU WANT A CONGREGATION?

## Overview

This repository contains an English translation of **“Do You Want a Congregation?”**, a series of editorial articles originally published in *Folkebladet* between September 29, 1897 and March 30, 1898. The text appears on pages 182–191 of the original collected volume and reflects a period of intense ecclesial debate among Norwegian Lutherans in North America concerning the nature of the Church, congregational life, and spiritual vitality.

The articles respond polemically yet pastorally to criticism raised in *Lutheraneren*, particularly the charge that the question “Do you want a congregation?” was prideful, divisive, or judgmental. The author argues instead that the question is biblically necessary and spiritually urgent.

## Central Argument

The text contends that **“congregation” (Church) is not merely an external form, legal order, or institutional arrangement**, but the living Body of Christ, brought into being and sustained by the Holy Spirit.

Key claims include:

* The Church exists only where the Spirit of God is present and active; form without Spirit is dead formalism.
* The habitual claim “all is in order” is identified as a false consolation that has historically lulled churches into spiritual sleep.
* True congregation requires awakening, repentance, faith, love, and the active participation of all members in Christ’s work.
* The Church is not a passive association supported by clergy alone, but a living fellowship in which every member shares responsibility for witness, labor, sacrifice, and suffering.
* Mission, love of neighbor, and service for the salvation of souls are not optional activities, but intrinsic expressions of congregational life.

Throughout, the author contrasts **sleeping, worldly, or merely nominal congregations** with **living congregations in Spirit and truth**, insisting that the latter cannot exist without conflict, suffering, and self-denial.

## Ecclesiological Emphases

The text develops a robust New Testament ecclesiology centered on the image of **the Church as the Body of Christ**:

* Christ is the living Head; the Church exists to receive His life and to manifest Him in the world.
* To belong to the Church is not merely to receive Word and Sacraments outwardly, but to live crucified with Christ and fruitful in love.
* Pastors exist not to replace the congregation’s calling, but to awaken, instruct, and spur the congregation to active Christian life.
* Congregations that claim the name “Church” while suppressing spiritual life or forbidding renewal bear grave responsibility.

The work repeatedly insists that the Church’s calling is not merely to live, but to **bear fruit**, and that fruitlessness calls the Church’s authenticity into question.

## Historical and Theological Context

These articles arise from a moment of crisis in Scandinavian-American Lutheranism, as inherited state-church patterns were increasingly questioned within a voluntary-church setting. The text addresses legalism, passivity, clericalism, and spiritual stagnation, while calling for renewed life grounded in Scripture, the Spirit, and active discipleship.

## Translation Principles

The translation seeks to preserve:

* the polemical and exhortational tone of the original
* long-form argumentation and rhetorical questioning
* sharp biblical rebukes and consolations
* New Testament imagery rendered in a dignified, King James–influenced English register

The aim is a faithful scholarly translation that retains the theological seriousness, urgency, and pastoral intensity of the original text.
