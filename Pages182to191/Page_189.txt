STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Aand (Spirit) – must retain theological sense of the Holy Spirit, not mere disposition.
* Kjærlighed – agape-like, self-giving love; avoid sentimental rendering.
* Menigheden – the Church as gathered people, not building or institution.
* Naadegaver – gifts of grace/charismata; must not become vague “talents.”
* Verdslig / verdsliggjort – worldly in a moral-spiritual sense, not merely secular.
* Væsen – essential nature, not external behavior only.
* Vækkelse – spiritual awakening/revival; must keep revivalist force.
* Besøgelsestid – biblical term (visitation); must echo Luke 19:44.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with logical pivots; must not be over-segmented.
* Parallel constructions (Tro/Kjærlighed; synlige/usynlige Ting).
* Rhetorical questions driving exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

* Relationship between Spirit, love, gifts, and work.
* Distinction between Church and world.
* Necessity of awakening for true church life.
* Conflict between spiritual life and death within the congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Warnings and woes must not be softened.
* Corporate address to conscience ("we").

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Et Folk i Kjærlighedens Selvopofrelse" – idiom of communal identity shaped by self-sacrificial love.
* "holde sig til de synlige/usynlige Ting" – echoes 2 Cor. 4:18.
* "søge sit eget" – Pauline idiom (Phil. 2:21).
* "gaa hen i Vingaarden" – Matt. 20 imagery for labor in God’s kingdom.
* "Døden staar Livet imod" – stark antithesis; must remain vivid.
* "Ve Verden for Forargelser" – direct quotation of Matt. 18:7 (KJV diction needed).
* "rystes i Soldet" – sifting imagery (Luke 22:31).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Source: God’s Spirit produces God’s love.
* Definition: The Church is a people of faith and self-giving love.
* Implication: Love necessarily expresses itself in work via gifts of grace.
* Contrast: World vs. Church (visible/self vs. invisible/God’s glory and neighbor’s good).
* Diagnosis: Worldliness prevalent in congregations.
* Question: Can it be otherwise? Should it not be otherwise?
* Condition: Change begins with individual repentance and awakening.
* Necessity: No true congregation without awakening.
* Conflict: Awakening causes offense and division.
* Warning: Woe because of offenses.
* Exhortation: Recognize the time of visitation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Corinthians 4:18 – seen vs. unseen.
* Philippians 2:21 – seeking one’s own.
* Matthew 20 – laborers in the vineyard.
* Matthew 18:7 – "Woe unto the world because of offences." (KJV)
* Luke 19:44 – "the time of thy visitation." (KJV)
* Luke 22:31 – sifting like wheat.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp contrasts and admonitions.
* Preserve communal self-examination.
* Keep the weight of judgment and hope intact.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" – must not be weakened.
* "maa" – necessity, not suggestion.
* Rhetorical imperatives must retain force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand – Spirit
* Kjærlighed – love
* Menighed – congregation / church
* Naadegaver – gifts of grace
* Vækkelse – awakening

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Vineyard, sleep/awakening, life vs. death, sifting – all retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity (worldliness, death)
* Hope (awakening possible)
* Warning (offense, visitation)

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences where exhortational.
* Preserve rhythmic balance and pauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

From the Spirit of God comes the love of God. Therefore the congregation is a people in the self‑sacrifice of love no less than in the devotion and rest of faith.

Therefore there is no congregation without gifts of grace with which to work and to serve; for love could not be, if it were not allowed to act. But where love comes forth in work, there the gift of grace is given.

Much lies in this, that the congregation is a people in faith and love. Herein lies the chief difference between the world and the congregation. All worldly men cleave to the visible things and seek their own. Believing men cleave to the invisible things and seek the glory of God and the good of their neighbor for time and eternity.

And when we consider this and seek to measure reality by it, then we begin to understand what is meant by worldly and world‑conformed congregations. For if this is the nature of the world, to strive after earthly things and to seek its own, then indeed there is much worldliness in all our congregations. And if this is the true nature of the congregation, to strive after the invisible and eternal things and to live for the cause of God’s kingdom and the salvation of souls, then there is not very much of the congregation’s true being in our congregations.

Can it be otherwise? — We will answer with another question: Should it not be otherwise? We know that it can be otherwise, if the unconverted are converted, if the sleeping awake, if the awakened go into the vineyard and labor.

We know that it can be otherwise, if only it becomes otherwise with each one of us.

Therefore it is right to say that there can be no congregation without awakening. If sleeping congregations are to become awakened congregations, then they must be awakened. But this is unpleasant and painful, so that many worldly members of the congregation are deeply offended. And it often comes to pass that death stands life so hard against in the worldly congregation, that either life is stifled again, or else the awakened are driven out.

Woe unto the world because of offences!

When therefore just now our church people are being shaken in the sieve, and the question is asked in many places: Shall we awake and become a congregation of God? then it behooves each congregation to consider what belongs to its peace; for it goes ill with that congregation which “knoweth not the time of its visitation.”
