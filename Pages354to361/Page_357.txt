STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Menighed” – carries ecclesial weight (congregation/church body), not merely an assembly.
* “Frivillighed” – not modern voluntarism; denotes Spirit-wrought willingness.
* “Selvbestemmelse” – must not imply autonomous human self-determination apart from God.
* “Hedningemissionærerne” – missionaries to the Gentiles, with Pauline theological context.
* “Aanden” / “den Helligaand” – must retain Trinitarian and pneumatological precision.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, layered sentences with explanatory clauses and theological pivots.
* Use of semicolons to advance argument rather than merely separate ideas.
* Embedded biblical quotations requiring careful cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Relation between divine election and human response.
* Nature of faith, calling, and the Spirit’s work in church formation.
* Sacramental language (“døbte til Kristi Død”).

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, didactic tone.
* Lutheran doctrinal firmness.
* Risk of modernizing into sociological language.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “blev troende” – not mere belief, but coming to faith (cf. Acts).
* “fik den Helligaand” – echo of Acts 2; reception of the Spirit.
* “døbte til Kristi Død” – Romans 6 imagery.
* “gjerne annammede Ordet” – Acts 2:41; KJV: “gladly received his word.”
* “betale Herren sine Løfter” – Psalmic vow language.
* “kaldte os fra Mørket til sit underfulde Lys” – 1 Peter 2:9.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Antioch as origin of Gentile mission.
* Universal scope of mission and rapid church formation.
* Principle: congregations arise through Spirit and faith.
* Clarification of voluntariness vs. divine determination.
* Scriptural grounding (Revelation, Luther).
* Ethical and ecclesial responsibility placed on believers.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 11–14 – Antioch and Pauline missions.
* Acts 2:38–41 – faith, Spirit, baptism.
* Romans 6:3 – baptized into Christ’s death.
* Revelation 22:17 – Spirit and the Bride.
* 1 Peter 2:9 – called from darkness to light.
* Psalmic vow language.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness of apostolic principle.
* Preserve exhortational clarity.
* Avoid sentimental or sociological dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Retain necessity and inevitability in divine action.
* Preserve impossibility claims (“umuligt bedre”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation.
* Frivillighed = willingness.
* Aand = Spirit.
* Tro = faith.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Life-giving water.
* Darkness to light.
* Paying vows.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Doctrinal explanation balanced with exhortation.
* Responsibility flowing from grace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences where intentional.
* Maintain rhythmic parallelism.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

And from this Antioch there also went forth the missionaries to the Gentiles; for from this time onward the occasion for the formation of congregations became as wide and spacious as the whole world; and indeed congregations were formed through Paul’s preaching, in an astonishingly short time, in a multitude of cities both in Asia and in Europe.

Always in the same manner: the preaching of the Gospel itself created the necessary presuppositions; for the congregations were formed of those who “became believers,” who “received the Holy Spirit,” who “were baptized into Christ’s death.” Always through the Spirit and through faith, which, when viewed from the outward side, manifests itself as complete and full willingness.

Willingness.

One might indeed gladly call it self-determination, provided that it is understood that thereby no opposition is intended to the Christian truth that this self-determination is, in its innermost ground, a divine determination; for those who “gladly received the word” are those whom the Lord has called and chosen and given the obedience of faith, so that their willingness is not of themselves, but of the Holy Spirit.

Here, then, the apostolic principle for the formation of congregations is clearly expressed: it is willingness—the willingness of the Spirit and of faith. It presents itself exactly as it is written in the Book of Revelation: “And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”

As already said, it is impossible to express the apostolic rule for the formation of congregations better than in Luther’s words: “The Holy Spirit calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the Christian congregation.”

With this willingness there is thus laid upon those who come to the congregation—called and drawn by the Spirit—the whole responsibility for the Kingdom of God, that is, the responsibility for the life and flourishing of the congregation, for its labor and its honor. For they are those who entered into the congregation not because other people judged them to be Christians, but because they judged themselves, and because they confessed the faith in the the Redeamer\footnote{The original text reads den forstaaede ("the understood"), likely a typographical or OCR error for Forsoneren ("the Redeemer"). The latter is more consistent with the surrounding context of confessing faith in Jesus Christ as Savior. — Present Ed.}, who was preached to them. To join oneself to the congregation and to be baptized was the same as to confess Jesus Christ as one’s Savior from sin, death, and the kingdom of Satan; and with this it followed of itself that he who knew the Savior in Christ was also willing to “pay unto the Lord his vows” and to be a witness of Him “who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.”
