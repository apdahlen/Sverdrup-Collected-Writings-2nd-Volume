STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden: must be rendered consistently as "the Congregation" or "the Church" with theological precision; context favors "the Congregation" as the living body gathered by the Spirit.
* Væsen og Virke: essence/nature and work/operation—avoid flattening to generic terms.
* Helligaands Gjerning: "the work of the Holy Spirit" with active, personal force.
* Erkjendelse: not mere knowledge but right apprehension/recognition.
* Forvansket: distorted, perverted—retain gravity.
* Arbeide: work/labor with ecclesial scope.
* Førelse, Styrelse, Aabenbaring: divine leading, governance, revelation—keep triadic weight.
* Erhverve sig: acquire/purchase—atonement resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic and sermonic cadence.
* Parenthetical explanations equating Congregation with Spirit’s work.
* Accumulated clauses that should not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as created and sustained by the Holy Spirit.
* Scriptural sufficiency regarding ecclesiology.
* Atonement language ("with His own blood").
* Pentecost imagery and incorporation into Christ’s body.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational address ("Brødre").
* Polemical firmness toward opponents of returning to Scripture.
* Lutheran confessional clarity without softening.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gaa tilbage til Skriften": return to Scripture as norm—Reformation idiom.
* "med al Kraft og al Saft": with all strength and vigor—retain intensity.
* "Som med en Solstraale": image of luminous clarity—keep metaphor.
* "reiser sit Rige": establishes/raises His kingdom—biblical resonance.
* "Stormens Kraft og Kjærlighedens Ild": Pentecost imagery (Acts 2).
* KJV equivalents naturally fit for Scripture-echoing phrases.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The New Testament gives clear and abundant instruction concerning the Congregation.
* Support: Post-Ascension revelation consistently concerns the Congregation/Spirit’s work.
* Polemic: Opponents cannot claim Scriptural silence.
* Practical Need: Present distortions necessitate sustained discussion.
* Confessional Grounding: Lutheran commitment to Scripture.
* Authority: Luther’s catechetical summary.
* Climax: God’s aim—acquiring a Congregation through Christ’s blood, formed at Pentecost.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts of the Apostles; Epistles; Revelation.
* "acquire a congregation with His own blood" (Acts 20:28 echo).
* Pentecost (Acts 2).
* "the body of Christ" (Ephesians 1:22–23; Colossians 1:18).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical firmness and pastoral urgency.
* Do not soften critique or exhortation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa gaa tilbage": must return—retain necessity.
* "intet vigtigere": nothing more important—absolute force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden: the Congregation.
* Helligaand: the Holy Spirit.
* Oplyser/helliggjør: enlightens/sanctifies—consistent usage.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sunbeam clarity, storm and fire, raising a kingdom, body imagery—retain.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From polemic to instruction to doxological climax—maintain contrasts.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic piling of clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Now, since the Congregation provides the New Testament with clear and abundant instruction—for indeed the whole revelation that is given in the New Testament after Christ’s Ascension speaks of the Congregation and of its nature and its work. The Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, and the Revelation of John speak continually of the Congregation, or, which is the same thing, of the work of the Holy Spirit; so that those who in our days are opponents of the Congregation and will hear nothing of the necessity of returning to Scripture when the question concerns the Congregation, cannot at any rate appeal to the claim that there is so little in the Bible about the Congregation that one cannot there receive sufficient light upon the matter.

Yet, as the situation actually stands among us, it is in fact distorted in so many and manifold ways that it is altogether reasonable that there should be a constant and continued discussion of the subject, in order, if possible, to gain more light concerning it. And since all our labor is dependent upon a right apprehension of the Congregation, there is nothing more important than to pursue this investigation with all strength and all vigor, so that the clearest results may be attained as soon as possible.

We are Lutherans, brethren, and this means first and foremost that we stand unshakably upon the ground of Scripture; therefore it is altogether right and genuinely Lutheran to seek the true instruction concerning the Congregation in the Holy Scripture itself.

And indeed Luther himself has shown the way also in this matter. There is no man for whom it has succeeded better to gather his thoughts into a brief chief summary than Luther. His Small Catechism is in this respect the greatest masterpiece that exists within the Christian Church. As with a sunbeam it is written there, what stands in the Catechism, that it is “the Holy Spirit who calls, gathers, enlightens, sanctifies the whole Christian Congregation on earth, and preserves it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.”

This is plain speech, and it is scriptural in the highest sense. It agrees not merely with the letter of Scripture, but in truth with its Spirit; and it is not attested by a single passage here or there, but the whole Scripture bears witness to this, that it is precisely the goal of all God’s work, leading, governing, and revelation for and with fallen mankind to raise up His kingdom upon earth, or, as it is said in Scripture, “to purchase for Himself a Congregation with His own blood,” and that this Congregation is that which the Spirit calls and gathers, enlightens and sanctifies from His day of Pentecost onward, when He came with the power of the storm and the fire of love upon the disciples of Jesus and bound them together into the body of Jesus, “which is the Congregation.”
