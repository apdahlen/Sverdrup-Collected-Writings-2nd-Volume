STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Indholden – sermonic sense of restraint/self-control, not mere temperance.
* Menighed – theological/ecclesial sense: congregation as God’s assembly.
* Gjerning – vocation/office-bound work, not generic action.
* Fordring – moral/theological claim or obligation.
* Oprigtighed – sincerity before God, not social honesty.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with exhortational rhythm.
* Repeated imperatives and parallel “kom til …” constructions.
* Semicolon logic that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of calling, responsibility before God, means of grace.
* Distinction between God’s judgment and human judgment.
* Imagery of wedding garment, keys, vineyard, harvest, cross and crown.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation to conscience.
* Warning against ecclesial laxity.
* Solemn pastoral authority that must not be softened.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

Therefore let the invitation have its voice; let the Gospel ring freely and fully, calling men to come in through this one true Door, that the house of the Lord may be filled.

This is the responsibility of the missionary pastor or the evangelist; this is his calling and his work. Lay then the responsibility upon those who hear the call and the invitation. They are accountable before God both to follow the invitation and to follow it rightly, that is, in the same spirit in which it is issued. Let it be said to them that they must come, and that they must put on the wedding garment when they come; let it also be said to them that in this matter they bear responsibility before the Lord and not before men. Let it be borne witness loudly and clearly that he who is part of God’s congregation thereby lays claim to being a true Christian, a child of God, and that both the congregation and the world have the right to expect of him that he conduct himself as a Christian, to the honor and praise of God’s name among men.

It avails nothing to suppose that we can set our judgment concerning a man in the place of the Lord’s judgment. He himself has the keys and opens and shuts in the one perfect manner; but upon us rests the responsibility for the unwearied labor of preaching the Word and bearing witness to the truth in season and out of season, and thus in time it will dawn upon the consciousness that the congregation and its outward ordering are a holy matter, that it is a temple of God which no one may dare to corrupt.

Under such fear of God and under the sense of this mighty responsibility must all organization of the congregation be undertaken; and it must be clearly testified that free as the congregation is, it is also obedient to God’s will and Word. And whoever feels within himself that this becomes an unbearable constraint, let him hasten to seek the Lord while he may be found, that from the Lord himself he may receive the freedom of the Spirit, which consists in that love which is poured out in our hearts through the forgiveness of sins and the blessed deliverance.

If then the question is asked: Shall we wait long before we organize a congregation, or shall we wait until we are certain who are believers, so that we may take them into the congregation and leave the others outside?—then the answer has already been given: Follow the Lord’s Word, and do not delay forming a congregation of those who are baptized into Christ and confess faith in him, whether they be many or few, and wait upon the Lord, who shall give the increase as it is pleasing to him.

It is not the number that matters; it is the Spirit. It is not our judgment that matters; it is the Lord’s. And he who comes bears himself the responsibility for his sincerity, when the invitation has sounded to him in undiminished fullness: Come to rest, come to labor; come to the Supper, come to the wedding; come to the vineyard, come to the harvest work; come to the Cross and come to the Crown!
