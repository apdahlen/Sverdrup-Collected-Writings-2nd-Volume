STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – must be rendered consistently as "congregation" (not merely "community" or "assembly") with ecclesial weight.
* "Menighedsdannelse" – formation or organization of a congregation; carries institutional and theological force.
* "Frikirken" – refers specifically to the Lutheran Free Church, not free church in general.
* "Lærespørgsmaal" – doctrinal question; must retain confessional gravity.
* "Aabenbaring" – revelation in the theological sense, not mere disclosure.
* "Væsen" – essence or nature; metaphysical/theological term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long hypotactic sentences with layered qualifications.
* Use of dashes and semicolons to guide argument flow.
* Rhetorical framing that should not be fragmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Authority of Scripture as sole rule (sola Scriptura).
* Nature and essence of the congregation as divinely defined.
* Distinction between preaching and organization.

Voice Hazards:

* Calm but firm doctrinal reasoning.
* Avoidance of pragmatic or managerial tone.
* Retention of measured, ecclesial seriousness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Regel og Rettesnor" – idiomatic pair meaning sole authoritative standard; best rendered as "rule and guiding norm" or similar.
* "gaa tilbage til Spørgsmaalet" – idiom meaning to return to foundational issue.
* No overt folk idioms; language is formal-ecclesial.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: explains purpose of the theme – to determine when and how congregations should be organized.
* Clarification: no universal rule can be given beyond general principles.
* Negative examples: rejects rigid timelines or prerequisites.
* Principle asserted: congregation is a doctrinal matter defined by NT revelation.
* Conclusion: proper organization depends on correct understanding of the congregation’s essence.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Implicit appeal to New Testament ecclesiology.
* Principle of Scripture as sole authority echoes Reformation doctrine.
* No direct quotations, but clear confessional resonance.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sober, instructional tone.
* Preserve firmness without polemic.
* Avoid modern managerial language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must" where doctrinal necessity is implied.
* Avoid weakening into "should" where obligation is intended.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Guds Ord – the Word of God
* Aabenbaring – revelation
* Væsen – essence

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Conceptual metaphors (foundation, rule, guiding norm) retained.
* No figurative flattening required.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Even, didactic tone throughout; no sharp contrasts to adjust.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences where argument unfolds gradually.
* Retain semicolon logic and measured pacing.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

2. The Conditions for the Formation of Congregations.

Source: Report of the Lutheran Free Church’s 9th Annual Meeting, 1905,
pp. 86–95. — Ed.

The intention in proposing this theme is doubtless to obtain an answer to the question: When is it right, timely, and justifiable to undertake the organization of a congregation in a given place, and which persons ought one to seek to include in the organization?

To a question of this kind, it is self‑evident that no answer can be given which lays down a rule applicable to all places and at all times, unless it be given in the form of a general principle, which must then be applied as appropriately as possible in the individual cases. We cannot say that a missionary pastor must always labor for a year with preaching before he seeks to have a congregation organized; neither can we say that he must first of all have a congregation established before he has the right to preach the Word of God to the people.

The question is of such a nature that only general or principial answers can be given.

And if it is this which is to be given here, then it is essential to hold fast that the Free Church, from the very beginning, has maintained that the question concerning the congregation and its nature must be clarified out of the divine revelation itself in the New Testament, because it is what one in the Lutheran Church calls a doctrinal question, in which the Word of God is the sole rule and guiding norm.

And the proper organization of the congregation stands in such a close and intimate connection with the congregation’s essence, that one must necessarily return to the question of the congregation itself, if one would gain get a handle on how the congregation and congregations are formed.
