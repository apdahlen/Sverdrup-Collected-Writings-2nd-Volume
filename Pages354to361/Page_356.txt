STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – carries ecclesiological weight beyond simple "congregation"; implies the living body of believers.
* "Aanden" – must be rendered as "the Spirit" with full Trinitarian and pneumatological force.
* "Gjerning" – more than "work"; implies divine operative activity.
* "annammede" – archaic reception implying willing, receptive faith.
* "Brodersamfund" – denotes spiritual fellowship, not mere social association.
* "Mellemveggen" – biblical metaphor requiring preservation (Ephesians 2).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained clauses with sermonic cadence.
* Semicolon-driven logic that must not be broken into modern short sentences.
* Embedded biblical quotations integrated into argument flow.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as Christ’s Body.
* Divine agency versus human reception in salvation.
* Role of Word, Spirit, Baptism, and Sacrament.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, didactic, Lutheran exhortational tone.
* Risk of flattening rhetorical force by modernization.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "samme Dag" – rhetorical emphasis on immediacy of the Spirit’s work.
* "annammede Peters Ord" – Acts 2 language; reception of apostolic preaching.
* "Herren lagde daglig til" – divine agency in church growth (Acts 2:47).
* "kalde, samle, oplyse og helliggjøre" – echoes Luther’s Catechism.
* "Mellemveggen" – Ephesians 2:14, abolition of Jew/Gentile division.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church is the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word.
* Evidence from Scripture concerning the Church’s beginning.
* Apparent dual agency (human reception / divine action) reconciled.
* Doctrinal clarification via Luther.
* Historical continuation in apostolic expansion.
* Culmination in Antioch as decisive ecclesial moment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 2:41 – "they that gladly received his word were baptized."
* Acts 2:47 – "the Lord added to the church daily."
* Luther’s Small Catechism – Third Article explanation.
* Ephesians 2 – breaking down the dividing wall.
* Acts 11 – Christians first called so in Antioch.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain doctrinal firmness and pedagogical clarity.
* Preserve exhortational seriousness without embellishment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and inevitability in divine action.
* Avoid weakening causal or theological claims.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Church
* Aanden = the Spirit
* Ordet = the Word
* Daab = Baptism
* Kristi Legeme = the Body of Christ

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Church as living, visible body.
* Spirit drawing and forming believers.
* Wall broken down between peoples.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Instructional explanation balanced with reverent affirmation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhythmic flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It is plainly evident from the testimony concerning the Church’s beginning that it is the work of the Spirit in Jesus’ believing disciples. And where the Spirit, through the Word, is permitted to carry out His work, there the Church is formed and founded and constituted “that very day,” so that there is no long waiting. There arise Baptism and the Supper and brotherly fellowship and common prayer as the marks that set forth the Church as visible before all eyes, so that it may be perceived and sensed both as a distinct society and as a living and drawing power, which continually gathers more of those who desire to belong.

Who then became members of the Church, and who decided whether they should be included or not?

Scripture says: “They that gladly received Peter’s word were baptized,” and thus they were added to the Church. But Scripture also says: “And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved.”

Behold here two testimonies concerning the same matter; these we must hold together, and the more we unite them in a spiritual manner, the more clearly will they also agree in that which Luther says: It is the work of the Holy Spirit to call, gather, enlighten, and sanctify the Church; for how else could this be fitting, that those who received the Word were added, and that the Lord added them, except precisely in this way—that the Lord worked through the Word, and the Spirit drew them by the calling Word and the regenerating Baptism into the Church, “which is the Body of Christ.”

This is the natural, and therefore the only right, way of forming the Church. And as it began in this manner, so it also continued in the apostolic age. When “Samaria received the Word of God” through the preaching of the scattered Christians, there too the Church came into being. Likewise in Galilee, yes, even as far as Antioch in Syria, where Christians from among the Jews and Christians from among the Gentiles were for the first time united in one Church and in one Body of Christ, in that “the middle wall” was broken down; and where therefore the new society received its own new name, in that the disciples there and then were called “Christians.”
