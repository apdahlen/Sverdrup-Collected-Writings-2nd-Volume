STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Statskirkens Børn" – metaphorical, ecclesial belonging; not literal children.
* "Tvang og Baand" – coercion imagery with biblical resonance (Ps. 2).
* "aandelige Vækkelse" – pietistic revival; not generic enthusiasm.
* "kjødelige Frihed" – theological term (fleshly liberty), not political freedom.
* "Folkekirkens Baand" – institutional bonds of the state church.
* "Brændebillede" – distorted caricature or false image, not mere picture.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal chains and contrasts.
* Embedded quotations from Scripture.
* Sermonic rhythm that resists short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between external compulsion and spiritual voluntariness.
* Doctrine of the Church as the Spirit’s work.
* Tension between false freedom and true evangelical liberty.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest pastoral warning.
* Polemical yet confessional Lutheran tone.
* Direct address to conscience and community.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Lad os sønderrive deres Baand..." – direct echo of Psalm 2:3 (KJV phrasing available).
* "Statskirkvæsenets fordærvelige Modsætning" – rhetorical antithesis.
* "kjødelige Frihed" – Pauline contrast (Gal. 5).
* "Herren kjender sine" – 2 Tim. 2:19.
* "afstaa fra Uretfærdighed" – KJV diction preserves moral force.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Coercive Christianity breeds hatred and rebellion.
* Observation: Emigration intensifies both rejection and reactionary traditionalism.
* Diagnosis: Confusion in church formation due to politics and coercion.
* Assurance: God’s true Church remains secure.
* Appeal: Labor for true congregational renewal.
* Warning: Avoid both coercion and doctrinal abandonment.
* Conclusion: True voluntariness belongs to the Holy Spirit alone.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 2:3 – rebellion against divine bonds.
* 2 Timothy 2:19 – the Lord knows His own.
* Apostles’ Creed explanation (Luther): work of the Holy Spirit in the Church.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp contrasts.
* Preserve warnings against fleshly freedom.
* Maintain solemn pastoral urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "er det nødvendigt" – must, is necessary.
* No weakening of obligation or warning.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation / Church (context-sensitive, consistent).
* Frivillighed = voluntariness (spiritual, not political).
* Helligaand = Holy Ghost / Holy Spirit (consistent choice).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Bonds, yokes, caricature, foundation.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment vs. hope.
* Confusion vs. divine stability.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and semicolon pivots.
* Maintain sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Now when these children of the State Church feel Christianity upon them as compulsion and bonds, this brings with it, for many, a bitter hatred of Christianity. It appears to them to lie obstructively in the way, partly of the satisfaction of their lusts, partly of the free development of thought. Especially when, through a spiritual awakening, the demands of Christianity press heavily upon the consciences, there is awakened also this human defiance and craving for freedom, which says: “Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.”

And not a few there are who, upon the crossing to America, tear asunder both the bonds of the National Church and the rope of the imposed Christianity, and they walk in the destructive opposite of the state‑church system: fleshly freedom.

But then, on the other hand, there is a very great multitude of people who here in America cling all the more zealously to the state‑churchly custom, as they feel that there is danger in the severing from the law of the State Church. And it can hardly be denied that many Norwegian congregations in America are formed upon the foundation of the Norwegian National Church, with some admixture of American township politics.

But amid all confusion and mismanagement there still stands the Lord’s firm foundation, and it bears the same old inscription: The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

Therefore it is not hopeless to labor for the restoration of the congregation and, little by little, to set forth a free‑church practice which returns to Luther and the New Testament, and brings clarity into the confused notions of the nature and organization of the Church.

The task is to come away from compulsion and politics in the formation of congregations and onward to true, spiritual voluntariness. But when we loosen ourselves from the coercion of the State Church and flee from its distorted image of the Church, it is necessary to be on our guard lest we also depart from Lutheranism and from the truth.

We must unreservedly go back to the principle of voluntariness, which is this, that “the Holy Ghost calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the congregation,” and at the same time be watchful that we do not put ourselves, or one or several persons, in the place of the Holy Ghost, so that we imagine we can call and gather, build up and form a congregation, provided only that everything proceeds according to our own head.
