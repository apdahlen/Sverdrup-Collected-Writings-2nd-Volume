STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Statskirken" – denotes the state church; must retain institutional and polemical weight.
* "Embedet" / "Embedsmand" – office / office-holder with bureaucratic connotations; risk of flattening into neutral "ministry".
* "Kald" – calling/vocation; not merely a job or position.
* "Menighed" – congregation as living ecclesial body, not just parish.
* "Vrængbillede" – strong term: grotesque distortion or caricature, not mild metaphor.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, chained sentences with semicolons and parenthetical asides.
* Rhetorical accumulation that builds moral force; must not be broken into short sentences.
* Frequent contrasts and parallelisms (King vs. Church vs. Congregation).

Theological Hazards:

* Relation between divine calling and human appointment.
* Ecclesiology: congregation as bearer of church life.
* Service to God vs. service to earthly authority.

Voice Hazards:

* Sharp polemical tone against the state church system.
* Irony and moral indignation must not be softened.
* Exhortational seriousness directed to conscience and judgment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kongelig Embedsmand" – idiomatically charged: servant of royal authority rather than of God/congregation.
* "løsreven fra al Rod i Guds Ord" – biblical image of uprooting; echoes scriptural plant imagery.
* "forflyttes til et bedre Kald" – ironic use of "better calling" as career advancement.
* "føre sit Embede af Kongens Naade" – deliberate parody of royal formulas ("by the grace of God").

KJV-style equivalents:

* "servant" rather than "employee".
* "rooted" / "uprooted" imagery retained.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The state church places priest and congregation in a fundamentally false relationship.
* Claim 1: Appointment by the king divorces the office from God’s Word and congregational life.
* Claim 2: This produces inevitable spiritual damage.
* Claim 3: The priest becomes a stranger and careerist rather than a shepherd.
* Claim 4: The system trains priests to serve authority, not truth.
* Conclusion: The entire arrangement is a grotesque distortion of God’s order and harms true cooperation in God’s kingdom.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Root / uprooting imagery – Psalm 1, Jeremiah 17.
* Service language – Romans 6, Galatians 1:10 (servants of men vs. servants of Christ).
* Calling ("Kald") – Pauline vocational theology.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity of critique.
* Preserve irony, especially in references to advancement and royal favor.
* Retain uncompromising moral judgment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke tænkes" → "cannot be conceived" (absolute impossibility).
* "maa gjøre Skade" → "must do harm" (necessity, not likelihood).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Kald = calling
* Embede = office
* Guds Rige = the Kingdom of God

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Root imagery, ladder of advancement, caricature imagery all preserved.
* No explanatory flattening.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemic dominates, with brief acknowledgments of exceptions.
* Contrast between rare faithful priests and the system as such.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where they carry rhetorical force.
* Semicolons and parallel clauses preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

In the State Church, the Office and the Priest are at once placed in the most erroneous relation to the congregation, in that the priest is a “royal civil servant” and is appointed by the King without any manner of participation on the part of the congregation. No arrangement can be conceived by which one could come farther away from what is Christian truth in this matter than this. It is absolutely torn loose from every root in the Word of God; it stands so completely outside all connection with congregational life that nothing else can be expected than that it must do harm. And harm it does.

For the priest comes to the congregation as a stranger, remains there as a stranger, and is “transferred” to a “better” calling, without the congregation receiving any other impression than that it has now been the man’s means of livelihood for a time, until he could obtain “something better.” That this is not a practice favorable to the work and fruit of the office, anyone can see.

And if the priest himself is also a man who labors as a “royal civil servant,” as he according to the demands of the State Church ought to do, then it is clear that such a man first becomes the King’s servant, then the Church’s servant, and then perhaps, if it can be managed, a very little bit of the congregation’s priest. It is another matter that there are here and there priests in the State Church who, independent of all human ordinances, occupy the place which the Word of God assigns to the priest; but they are few, and they are by no means genuine “state priests.”

He who will be a good “royal civil servant” in the priestly calling must first pass through a godless schooling and thereafter through a highly dubious student life, wherein all sharp edges, all independent conviction, all living apprehension of the truth are ground away; and then, when he has learned to bow and bend both himself and the truth, he is “finished” and can discharge his office by the King’s grace with just as much propriety as a bailiff or a magistrate. If he has become sufficiently polished, he can also confidently reckon that the ladder of advancement will be tolerably easy for him to climb, step by step, until he obtains a “quiet calling” in his old age.

But the whole arrangement is in its very essence a complete caricature of God’s order and manner for the congregation, and therefore fit only to bring priest and congregation into a false relation to one another. Even where the priest, as sometimes happens, is an upright man, and the congregation harbors some serious thought, even there this perverted relation—that the priest is the King’s civil servant instead of the congregation’s office-bearer—works in a high degree to the detriment of a united cooperation for the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God.
