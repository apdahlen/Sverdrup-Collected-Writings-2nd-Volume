STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Embedet" – not merely an office, but a divinely instituted pastoral ministry.
* "Menigheden" – congregation understood theologically as the body of believers.
* "betjene" – service/ministry with sacramental and Word-centered connotations.
* "Opbyggelse" – edification in a Pauline, ecclesial sense.
* "Aand og Sandhed" – Johannine phrase with strong biblical resonance.
* "Utide" – archaic usage meaning "out of season" (2 Tim. 4:2).
* "Lægmandsvirksomheden" – lay activity in the church, with ecclesiological implications.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered clauses and theological pivots.
* Parallel constructions balancing divine authority and pastoral humility.
* Sermonic rhythm that resists fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Word as means of grace.
* Relationship between divine calling and congregational calling.
* Balance of authority and servanthood in ministry.
* Lay participation versus clerical ministry.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of softening exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Risk of flattening pastoral gravity into neutral prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "i Aand og Sandhed" – echo of John 4:24; best rendered with KJV phrasing.
* "prædike Ordet i Tide og Utide" – direct echo of 2 Timothy 4:2.
* "Lader eder forlige med Gud" – quotation of 2 Corinthians 5:20 (KJV: "be ye reconciled to God").
* Metaphors of food, hammer, balm – biblical images (Jer. 23:29; Isa. 1:6).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The pastoral office is both God’s service and the congregation’s service in the Word.
* Development: Mutual obligations of pastor and congregation.
* Contrast: Authority vs. humility; strength vs. suffering.
* Consequence: Proper relationship yields spiritual vitality and growth.
* Transition: Question of lay activity in relation to the pastoral office.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 4:24 – worship in spirit and truth.
* 2 Timothy 4:2 – preaching in season and out of season.
* 2 Corinthians 5:20 – ambassadorial ministry of reconciliation.
* Jeremiah 23:29 – Word as hammer.
* Isaiah 1:6 – balm/healing imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain exhortational force and solemnity.
* Avoid sentimental or motivational dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity ("maa", "skal") as moral and divine obligation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Embedet – the ministry / the pastoral office.
* Menigheden – the congregation.
* Ordet – the Word.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve metaphors of growth, food, hammer, balm, house of God.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity (warning, rebuke) balanced with consolation and hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentence flow and rhetorical cadence suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The ministry is the congregation’s service in this Word of God.
Here is the other side of the matter. The congregation has the right to demand
that the pastor truly, in spirit and in truth, shall “minister” to it with the
Word of the Lord. The body of Christ is to grow by the same Word through which
the life of God has been awakened. Not for his own advantage or his own honor
is the pastor to preach, but for the edification of the congregation. As
independent of all fear of men and favor of men as the pastor must be in the
administration of the office, so humble and willing to serve must he be when it
comes to preaching the Word in season and out of season. Always willing to
admonish the rebellious, to instruct the erring, to comfort the afflicted, and
to bear with the weak, he must not shrink back from becoming the least of all.

It is with the pastoral office in the same way as with a Christian’s position
in the world: there is a height and power of the Spirit in it, because it is the
Spirit of God who sends him to cry out in Christ’s stead: “Be ye reconciled to
God!” But there is also the humility and poverty of the Spirit, because there is
unceasingly to be borne the contradiction of sinners, the sorrow of the erring,
and the humiliation of the proud. Yet through it all it is love that gives
strength and wisdom, endurance and patience for the work of ministry.

It is therefore necessary to hold fast with unwavering faithfulness, if pastor
and congregation are to stand in a right relationship to one another, that the
office is God’s service in the Word and the congregation’s service in the same
Word. If the one is misunderstood or the other forgotten, the relationship
becomes perverted. Let the pastor stand manfully and undaunted upon God’s truth,
and let the congregation bow beneath the Word; and let the pastor always be bent
to serve all, and the congregation rightly eager to demand his service with the
Word which the Lord has entrusted to it—then all stands well in the house of
God, which is His congregation. Then shall the Lord’s faithful promise, that
His Word shall be food for the hungry, a hammer to shatter hearts, a balm to heal
the wounded, prove itself as living truth in the congregation; and there shall
be a fellowship of love which with irresistible power shall draw more and more
into itself and unto God.

If this, then, is the proper relationship of the office to the congregation—that
it is the proclamation of the Word which the congregation by its call entrusts
to him whom God has sent and sends, and that it is both God’s service and the
congregation’s service in the Word—then the question arises: Is the congregation
now bound to be edified only by the pastor, or is it its duty and right also to
edify itself? In other words: Is lay activity abolished by the congregation’s
calling of a pastor, or is it confirmed? We shall in what follows speak somewhat
more closely of this matter, which is so exceedingly important in these days.
