STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "frie Kirke" – denotes a Free Church polity, not merely "independent"; ecclesiological weight.
* "retter sig med Nødvendighed" – implies an organic, necessary self-correction.
* "Kaldsretten" – technical term for the right of calling a pastor.
* "Nødstilstand" – emergency/abnormal condition, not mere inconvenience.
* "Friheden" and "Rettigheder" – juridical-ecclesial freedom/rights, not generic liberty.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with causal chains and concessive clauses.
* Semicolon logic that carries argument pivots.
* Parenthetical examples ("f. Eks.") integral to reasoning.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of congregation’s divine responsibility.
* Understanding of church authority vs. state authority.
* Moral responsibility and freedom bound together.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest polemical tone against clerical centralization.
* Collective "we" addressing conscience of congregations.
* Warning rhetoric that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "det retter sig med Nødvendighed" – idiom of inevitable correction; conveys providential logic.
* "bort Held" – literally "good fortune," but implies providential benefit.
* "tage Arbeide og Ansvar fra os" – idiom of relieving burden that actually strips agency.
* "Byrde" in quotation marks – ironic usage, signaling false compassion.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: A free church necessarily orders itself rightly.
* Historical example: Norwegian immigrants in America.
* Counterfactual argument: dangers had Norway had ecclesial sending authority.
* Residual confusion about ties to the State Church.
* Present consensus: congregational call is normative.
* Rejection of delegated call as emergency only.
* Warning: removing responsibility removes freedom.
* Conclusion: such "help" must be resisted.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Implicit echo of stewardship (Luke 12; 1 Corinthians 4).
* Freedom and responsibility bound together (Galatians 5:1).
* Burden-bearing language (Matthew 11:30, inverted rhetorically).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness against ecclesial paternalism.
* Preserve moral warning about loss of rights.
* Retain collective exhortation and confidence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan" rendered as "must," "cannot," "ought not."
* Preserve necessity and prohibition without weakening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Menighed" consistently as "congregation."
* "Præst" as "pastor."
* "Frihed" as "freedom" with ecclesial sense.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Burden imagery retained.
* Organic self-ordering metaphor preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical calm → polemical warning → firm conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolons retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

In the free Church the matter is naturally set right at once; for it corrects itself of necessity. Thus it has come to pass among the Norwegians in America, that since no one sent them pastors, the congregations themselves were compelled to choose them. In this respect it was a piece of good fortune that the Norwegian Church is a state church, and that it is the King who sends pastors to the congregations there. For had it, for example, been the case that an ecclesiastical authority in Norway had sent out pastors, then it would naturally also have sent pastors for the emigrants, and it might have taken a long time before matters had come into their proper order. For the Norwegian King there could be no access to send pastors to a foreign land. Nevertheless, it was not altogether avoided that both people and pastors in the beginning regarded themselves as a branch not only of the Lutheran Church, but also of the Norwegian State Church; and even to this day the Norwegian Synod is often simply called “the State Church.” It is also related that a congregation was organized somewhere in America with the definite understanding that it should belong directly under the Norwegian Church Department, which sufficiently shows that it did not at once dawn upon all that it was truly a Free Church which was in the process of forming.

Those times, however, are now almost past, and it has become a recognized matter that the congregation among us possesses the right of election, and possesses it alone. To be sure, it is used rather frequently, especially in the Norwegian Synod, that the right of calling is entrusted to individual persons or to the church council; yet it is willingly acknowledged that this is an emergency condition, which ought not to exist. For our part we can by no means find that such necessity is compelling, and we scarcely believe that in our entire fellowship there is any congregation which will do this; and we are assured that none ought to do it. For although it may occasion difficulties for a congregation to obtain a pastor when it must itself extend the call, yet we are also exceedingly apprehensive when we hear that someone wishes to take labor and responsibility from us; for we know that they always take freedom along with them. Therefore we oppose all who would take this “burden” from the congregation, because it cannot be taken away without the congregation at the same time suffering loss in its most precious rights.
