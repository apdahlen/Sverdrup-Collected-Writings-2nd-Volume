STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Embede" / "Embedet": carries ecclesiological and doctrinal weight beyond modern "office"; refers to the divinely instituted ministry of Word and Sacrament.
* "Frimenigheden" / "Frikirken": not generic "free church," but historically conditioned voluntary Lutheran congregations; must avoid modern evangelical connotations.
* "fjødelig": older form of "kjødlig" (fleshly, carnal) with Pauline resonance.
* "Umyndighed": spiritual immaturity, not merely legal minority.
* "Forsyndelsens Gjerning": proclamation/preaching of the Word; must not be reduced to general "teaching."

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, chained sentences with causal logic and rhetorical pivots.
* Frequent semicolon-style contrasts that must remain intact.
* Sermonic pacing that resists fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of ministry versus clericalism.
* Relation between congregation and minister.
* Authority derived from Word and Spirit, not from office as such.
* Errors of both Roman clericalism and Quaker anti-ministerialism.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest polemical Lutheran tone.
* Warning against both priestly domination and congregational reductionism.
* Risk of softening sharp rebukes or flattening contrasts.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kaste Forvirring ind i en Sag": idiom meaning to obscure or disorder a matter of grave importance.
* "Tidslighedens Skaar": imagery of fragility and brokenness tied to earthly interests.
* "saa trang, saa skarpt som en Knivsæg": vivid biblical-style metaphor for narrow truth (cf. Matt. 7:14).
* "Mand og Hustru": metaphor of marriage used polemically; must retain its provocative force.
* "Præsteløshed": not mere absence of clergy, but principled denial of the ministry.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: No question has caused more conflict in the church than the question of the ministry.
* Diagnosis of causes: human passions, pride, worldly interests.
* Assertion: Free churches cannot escape this struggle.
* Contrast: State church vs. free church dynamics.
* Doctrinal clarification: Scripture rejects clerical aristocracy yet affirms necessity of the ministry.
* Double rejection: Roman priest-exaltation and Quaker minister-denial.
* Contemporary application: American controversies.
* Conclusion: Both extremes fail to give the ministry its biblical place.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Pauline anthropology in "fjødlig" (Rom. 7; 1 Cor. 3).
* Ministry as gift of the Spirit (Eph. 4:11–12).
* Narrow way imagery (Matt. 7:14).
* Servanthood language implicitly echoing Christ’s teaching (Matt. 20:26).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain polemical sharpness against both clerical domination and populist reduction.
* Retain moral urgency and ecclesial seriousness.
* Avoid conciliatory or irenic smoothing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity expressed in "maatte," "uundgaaeligt," "er det klart."
* Avoid weakening inevitability or obligation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Embede" → "the ministry" or "the ministerial office" consistently.
* "Menighed" → "the congregation."
* "Naadegave" → "gift of grace."
* "Aand" → "the Spirit."

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve knife-edge, marriage, and fleshly imagery.
* Do not explain metaphors away.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Preserve shifts between analysis, warning, and doctrinal assertion.
* Maintain tension between extremes.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where intentional.
* Preserve rhetorical balance and parallelism suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The Ministry in the Free Congregation

There is scarcely any question within the Christian Church that has occasioned so many difficulties and so much strife as the question of the ministerial office. Personal passions, zeal and envy without understanding, temporal pride and spiritual immaturity have continually and persistently exerted their influence so as to cast confusion into a matter which concerns not only the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God in the land, but also many personal interests of a purely temporal kind. It was unavoidable that, since ministers are human beings, they should be subject to the frailty of earthly conditions; and when temporal interests became so inextricably bound up with the work for the Kingdom of God, many frictions were bound to arise.

The free church community has no way of escaping this difficulty. For although the state church may have made the question more complicated and rendered its proper solution impossible, the real struggle concerning the right place of the ministry nevertheless begins in earnest only within the free church. In the state church the ministry is once and for all placed in a thoroughly distorted position, and there is no one who expects or demands that it should be otherwise; but in the free church the demand arises that the ministry shall be in its proper place, and since this is a most burdensome place, the struggle comes both from hostile ministers and from dead congregations against the very nature of the ministry and its authority.

There is nothing in the Word of God that lends any support to the fleshly mind. And although both bishops and popes have labored to interpret the Word of God to their own fleshly advantage and in favor of a proud clerical aristocracy, it is nevertheless just as certain that there is no room in the Word of God for a great and mighty priestly estate that claims a special divine authority and a peculiar position between the congregation and God, different from that of any other Christian. But if the Word of God serves no clerical estate, it all the more strongly emphasizes the necessity of the ministry, of the service of the Word, of the work of proclamation, which is to be carried out by the congregation through such Christian persons as are fitted for it by the gift of grace which the Spirit of the Lord has given them. Thus, just as far as Roman priest-exaltation is removed from faith in Christ and from the truth, just so far is the Quakers’ priestlessness removed from the sound form of God’s congregation.

We thus soon see that here the way of truth is so narrow, so sharp as the edge of a knife. And it is clear that conflicts were bound to arise here. In America these have assumed such a form that on the one side the claim has been made that minister and congregation are bound to one another as husband and wife—naturally with the understanding that the minister is the husband, and that he thereby enjoys several advantages which the wife, or the congregation, does not possess. Likewise, from the same quarter, the greatest efforts have been made to suppress so-called “lay activity” within the congregation. On the other side there has been advanced the sinful assertion: “The minister is the servant of the congregation,” and with that one has thought to have decided the whole matter without further trouble. Both of these views, which in fact may be summed up in the question, “Is the minister the lord of the congregation or its servant?” are equally unfit to give the ministry the significance and the position which the Word of God assigns to it.
