STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirken" refers not generically to any free church, but to the 19th‑century Norwegian Free Church movement, carrying ecclesiological weight.
* "verdslige Præster" denotes priests governed by worldly spirit, not merely secular clergy.
* "ensidige" here implies doctrinal or spiritual one‑sidedness, not simple partiality.
* "Trældom" evokes theological bondage/slavery language with Pauline resonance.
* "Leiesvend" is a biblical-theological term (hireling), not simply an employee.
* "Embede" carries strong confessional and vocational theology beyond modern "office."

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained sentences with embedded qualifications and contrasts must not be fragmented.
* Semicolon logic and adversative pivots (men, thi, naar) structure the argument rhetorically.
* Parenthetical clarifications define orthodox vs. false interpretations and must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of ministry: divine calling vs. human authority.
* Distinction between service to congregation and obedience to God.
* Use of biblical metaphors: shepherd, hireling, wolf, salt, rotten tree.
* Ecclesiological danger of congregational tyranny.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, warning, sermonic tone addressing conscience.
* Sharp polemic against both clerical tyranny and congregational domination.
* Moral urgency must not be softened or psychologized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Manden til Hustruen" – marriage metaphor often used in hierarchical ecclesiology; rejected here.
* "Forligelsens Tjeneste" echoes 2 Corinthians 5:18 (ministry of reconciliation).
* "i hans Fodspor, som kom for at tjene alle" echoes Christological servant language (Mark 10:45).
* "bøier Sandheden og Retten for en Bid Brød" idiom meaning compromising truth for livelihood.
* "uden Salt" echoes Matthew 5:13.
* "raadent Træ" echoes Matthew 7:17–19.
* "Naar Ulven kommer, saa flyr Leiesvenden" echoes John 10:12.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Free Church faces grave dangers concerning the understanding of ministry.
* First danger: clerical tyranny justified by false marital analogy.
* Second danger: misconstrued doctrine that the pastor is merely the congregation’s servant.
* Clarification of true meaning of pastoral service.
* Exposure of false meaning leading to denial of divine calling.
* Consequences: creation of hirelings, corruption of truth, ecclesial decay.
* Concluding warning: mutual ruin of pastor and congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Corinthians 5:18 – ministry of reconciliation.
* Mark 10:45 – Christ came to serve.
* John 10:11–13 – hireling fleeing the wolf.
* Matthew 5:13 – salt losing its savor.
* Matthew 7:17–19 – rotten tree bearing bad fruit.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severe warnings and prophetic denunciation.
* Preserve contrasts between true and false service.
* Maintain accusatory force toward both pastors and congregations.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and impossibility: "kan," "maa," "kun."
* Maintain absolute limits on pastoral obedience: only what God commands.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Præst = pastor/minister (consistently minister).
* Menighed = congregation.
* Tjener/Tjeneste = servant/service with theological weight.
* Leiesvend = hireling (biblical term).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shepherd imagery, salt, tree, wolf, hireling preserved verbatim.
* No explanatory paraphrase replacing images.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning dominates, with brief clarification of orthodox teaching.
* No sentimental consolation introduced.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically necessary.
* Clausal rhythm suited for proclamation preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Free Church is thus in the very greatest danger of being tyrannized both by worldly priests and by one‑sided, though earnest, men. And the doctrine that the relation between pastor and congregation is as that of the husband to the wife is indeed in many respects appealing enough, but it lacks foundation in the Word of God and therefore leads to bondage.

But the Free Church also has another danger, which is expressed in the saying: the pastor is the servant of the congregation. The saying is indeed correct, if it is rightly understood—that is, if it is taken as an expression of the simple truth of God’s Word, that all the pastor’s work is a ministry of reconciliation, to draw souls to God; a service in the congregation and for the congregation; a service in His footsteps who came to serve all. But there is another understanding of this saying, according to which it simply means that the pastor shall do whatever the congregation commands, whether it be one thing or another; and in this sense the saying becomes purely and simply a denial that the pastor is the servant of the Lord and can do only what God has commanded, for the service of the congregation.

This understanding—that the pastor in every respect stands in the same relation to the congregation as a hired servant to the one who has hired him—necessarily produces hirelings who willingly bend truth and justice for a morsel of bread. And yet there may be more congregations of this sort, who gladly hire a hireling, than anyone could suppose. This is a dreadful danger for the Free Church; for where the congregation not only governs its own affairs, but also masters the Word of God and induces the pastor to assist it in carrying through things that are unchristian in their inmost root, there the whole congregation becomes without salt, and soon an utterly rotten tree, which must fall under the rapid development that free conditions bring with them. When the wolf comes, the hireling flees, and the sheep are scattered and torn. It is scarcely possible to deny that there are in the Free Church several things which may soon entice congregations into such a view of pastor and office. Once a worldly spirit and tone gain dominion in a congregation, and the pastor does not all the more firmly maintain his office as a service of God, then now one consideration and now another may soon make him a slave instead of a servant, and congregation and pastor alike are soon equally far from the Lord’s right way—to their own destruction and to the offense of the congregation of God.
