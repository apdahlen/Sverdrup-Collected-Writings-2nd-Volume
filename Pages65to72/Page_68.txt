STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighedsvalg" – carries ecclesiological weight: congregational calling, not mere election.
* "Kald" – vocational/divine calling, not simply appointment.
* "Herre eller Tjener" – echoes biblical lordship/servanthood dichotomy.
* "Frikirken" – Free Church context; not generic church.
* "hierarkiske Tendenser" – doctrinally loaded critique.
* "Præstekaldet" – abstract force of clericalism, not a single call.
* "slet Bindings" – idiomatic, morally pejorative motive.
* "Lægmandsvirksomhed" – pietistic term: lay activity/ministry.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with embedded causal and concessive clauses.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation.
* Rhetorical escalation without paragraph breaks.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of call, authority, freedom of the Christian congregation.
* Distinction between divine order and human abuse.
* Ecclesiology: priesthood vs. congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Sharp polemical tone against clerical abuse.
* Earnest, warning voice addressed to collective conscience.
* Risk of softening critique by modern phrasing.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "et ret Kald" – a true/legitimate calling before God.
* "slet Bindings Skyld" – literally "for base gain’s sake"; moral corruption.
* "faste Mænd" – trusted power-holders, not spiritually steadfast men.
* "stænser al Lægmandsvirksomhed" – suppresses lay spiritual initiative.
* "Folket i Søvne taber sin kristelige Frihed" – metaphor of unconscious loss, spiritual negligence.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Affirmation: congregational calling is legitimate.
* Problem statement: legitimacy of call does not settle authority question.
* Observation: Free Church susceptible to extremes.
* Main critique: clerical power-seeking.
* Mechanisms of abuse described step-by-step.
* Consequence: spiritual freedom lost through passivity.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Lord vs. servant (Matt. 20:25–28).
* Christian freedom (Gal. 5:1).
* Suppression of awakening echoes warnings against quenching the Spirit (1 Thess. 5:19).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain accusatory clarity.
* Preserve moral indignation.
* Avoid neutral sociological tone.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Retain necessity and consequence.
* Do not weaken inevitability implied in descriptions.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Menighed" consistently as congregation.
* "Præst" as minister/priest depending on context.
* "Frihed" as Christian liberty.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleep metaphor retained.
* Political maneuvering imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Initial measured tone → escalating warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where possible.
* Sermonic flow maintained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

A truly congregational election is thus the manner in which our ministers are called, and there has surely never been anyone who has attempted to deny that this is a rightful calling. But by this the question is far from settled whether the minister is lord or servant within the congregation. The circumstance that he, in full accordance with God’s Word, is chosen by the congregation, does not yet determine his future position. It has indeed been shown that the Free Church, with ministers chosen by the congregation, has been able to go to the greatest extremes on both sides. In particular, hierarchical tendencies readily unfold themselves within the Free Church.

There are two ways in which the clerical calling easily presses its way into God’s Church where it is left entirely to itself. The minister and the clergy may strive after power either from the basest motives or from the noblest motives without true insight into the nature of the congregation. There are, namely, ministers who seek power for base gain’s sake. Their number has unfortunately always been great. In the Free Church these have an excellent opportunity. They employ as their means the most pitiable form of politics. They establish associations in which clerical agreements secure them against the possibility that the congregation might obtain any other minister than the one upon whom the ministers themselves have agreed. When they are thus secure from that side, they then secure themselves against the congregation’s ability to depose them by inducing the congregation to accept such provisions concerning the removal of the minister as in fact render this impossible. Then, by personal means, they secure for themselves certain “fixed men” in every congregation, and then the demands begin gradually to rise. That in this way matters may be driven quite far is evident enough to all who know how things stand among large portions of our people. And when such a minister at the same time suppresses all lay activity within the congregation, seeks to dampen every awakening wherever it is perceived, and with a blind eye passes by dancing and drink and debauchery within the congregation, so that in the end the religion of the people consists in going to church and paying the minister, then it is clear that the people, while asleep, lose their Christian freedom, because they have no use for it.
