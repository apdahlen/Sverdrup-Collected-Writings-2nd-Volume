STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheder" – ecclesial term meaning congregations in a churchly, not merely social, sense.
* "Grundvold" – foundation with biblical resonance (cf. 1 Cor. 3), not merely "basis".
* "tidsdelige" – temporal, worldly, non-spiritual; must not be reduced to "practical".
* "Mandtalslisterne" – membership rolls/registers, with institutional and moral weight.
* "Agtelse" – respect or due regard, moral-ecclesial nuance.
* "Ærbødighed" – reverence, especially toward holiness.
* "Dødsspirren" – death-germ, seed of death; metaphorically potent.
* "Varme" – warmth as spiritual fervor or life, not emotional excitement.
* "Lidenskab" vs. "Fanatisme" – passion vs. fanaticism; must be carefully distinguished.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cumulative sentences with causal and concessive clauses.
* Sermonic rhythm relying on contrast and escalation.
* Use of semicolons to pivot argument rather than to separate thoughts.

Theological Hazards:

* True foundation of the Church as the preaching of God’s Word.
* Purity of the congregation versus numerical growth.
* Freedom of the people (conscience) in ecclesial matters.
* Work of the Spirit versus human passion.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory tone warning of spiritual decay.
* Moral seriousness that must not be softened or psychologized.
* Rhetorical gravity rooted in pastoral concern.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "stiftet paa en ganske anden Grundvold" – idiomatically echoes biblical building imagery (Matt. 7; 1 Cor. 3).
* "rent udvortes, rent tidsdelige Fordele" – emphatic repetition stressing purely external motives.
* "Lokkemiddel" – bait or lure; morally charged, suggesting manipulation.
* "høste, som de har saaet" – direct biblical proverb (Gal. 6:7).
* "rask Vækst" – rapid growth, with implied superficiality.
* "drive en Menighed op til en vis Høide" – metaphor of forced upward growth.
* "Dødsspirren i sig" – organic metaphor: death already latent within.
* "indblæse" – breath imagery recalling Gen. 2:7 and John 20:22.
* "fortærer" – consuming fire imagery, biblically resonant.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Acknowledgment of an uncomfortable truth.
* Identification of congregations founded on improper grounds.
* Specification of motives: party-spirit, hatred, temporal advantage.
* Ethical critique of membership practices.
* Diagnosis: lack of respect for freedom and purity.
* Principle of divine recompense.
* Apparent success explained by human passion.
* Final warning: inevitable destruction without the Spirit.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Foundation imagery – 1 Corinthians 3:10–15.
* Reaping and sowing – Galatians 6:7.
* Breath/Spirit giving life – Genesis 2:7; Ezekiel 37; John 20:22.
* Consuming fire – Hebrews 12:29 (inverted: fanaticism as false fire).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warning tone without mitigation.
* Preserve moral clarity in condemning manipulation and fanaticism.
* Maintain pastoral urgency and prophetic firmness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan det ikke skjules" – must be rendered as impossibility of concealment.
* "vil høste" – certainty, not possibility.
* Conditional warning retains full force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Guds Ord – God’s Word.
* Aand – Spirit.
* Renhed – purity.
* Lidenskab/Fanatisme – passion/fanaticism (kept distinct).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Agricultural metaphors retained.
* Organic life/death imagery preserved.
* Fire imagery kept vivid and destructive.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From sober observation to sharp warning.
* Contrast between apparent growth and hidden death.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Semicolons maintained to carry sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

APD: Independent AI verification 

Nevertheless, it cannot be concealed that there are a considerable number of congregations in America which have been established upon a foundation altogether different from the preaching of God’s Word. There are even, within the small circle where we are known, congregations whose very existence we fear is owing to party-spirit and hatred, and to purely temporal motives. And there are many members entered upon the rosters who would never have been there, had not purely outward, purely temporal advantages been employed as a lure to draw them in. There has not everywhere been the proper regard for the freedom of the people, nor yet the proper reverence for the purity of the congregation. It is therefore natural that such congregations will reap as they have sown. They have at times had a rapid growth, because passion and fanaticism are indeed powerful forces for swiftly driving a congregation up to a certain height; but they carry the germ of death within themselves, and unless the Spirit of the Lord breathes into them a warmth other than that of passion, the artificial fire of fanaticism will soon devour them.
