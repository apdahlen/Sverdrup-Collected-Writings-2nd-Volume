STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Guds Førelser" – providential leadings, not mere events.
* "Menighedsstiftelse" – founding/constitution of a congregation with ecclesial weight.
* "Udsondring" – separation with biblical connotations.
* "Bryllupsklædningen" – Matthew 22 imagery; must retain metaphor.
* "Vækkelsesprædiken" – revival sermon, pietistic urgency.
* "Søndermælelse" – crushing, breaking; spiritual contrition.
* "Gjenstridighed" – resistance, obstinacy toward the Word.
* "Opbyggelser" – edifying gatherings, not entertainment.
* "Partisindets Bitterhed" – factional spirit; polemical danger.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with concessive clauses.
* Sermonic pacing; imperatives embedded mid-sentence.
* Coordination by semicolons; should not be over-segmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Discernment of true faith vs external judgment.
* Role of Word vs human organization.
* Doctrine of vocation of the laity.
* Love of Christ vs party spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Warnings against haste and factionalism.
* Authority grounded in Scripture, not office alone.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Bryllupsklædningen" – allusion to Matthew 22:11–14; righteousness before God.
* "Lade sig frivilligen nøde" – freely constrained by the Word; paradox of grace.
* "Ordet have Tid til at øve sin Virkning" – Word as active agent (Isaiah 55).
* KJV equivalents preserve gravity: "wedding garment," "edification," "the Word."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Premise: Present providences and dangers require careful congregation formation.
* Thesis: Best congregation is both separation from indifference/denial and gathering by the Word alone.
* Method: Allow time; avoid premature organization.
* Principle: Judgment of hearts belongs not to priest nor congregation.
* Practice: Preach awakening sermons before organizing.
* Extension: Lay vocation to gather when knowing Christ.
* Warning: Hasty foundations lead to collapse.
* Climax: Unity must be Christ’s love, not party bitterness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 22 – wedding garment.
* Romans 10 – Word preached.
* Isaiah 55 – Word accomplishing its purpose.
* 1 Corinthians 3 – building and foundation.
* Matthew 18 – where two or three gather.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain imperatives: "let," "remember," "be cautious."
* Do not soften warnings against haste and factional spirit.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" → "shall"
* "maa" → "must"
* "ikke er nødvendigt" → "it is not necessary"

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Ordet – the Word
* Opbyggelse – edification
* Kjærlighed – love

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Wedding garment metaphor retained.
* Building imagery preserved implicitly.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warnings; patience in counsel; love in conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved with semicolons.
* Imperative rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

APD: Independent AI verification 

With these providential dealings of God and these peculiar dangers before our eyes, we therefore believe that the best founding of a congregation is that which at one and the same time is a sifting out from all those who either live in complete indifference or in outright denial, and likewise a gathering of all those who, by the Word of God and by nothing else, are freely constrained to enter.

Let it indeed take time to have a congregation built up; but let it also be well understood that it is neither priest nor congregation that shall judge whether those who enter have on the wedding garment.

If in a place there has long been no preaching, then let a powerful and earnest awakening sermon be heard, perhaps for a long time, before a congregation is organized. Let the Word have time to exercise its work, both unto brokenness and unto resistance, if so it must be, before a congregation is founded.

And remember, that it is not necessary that there must be a priest to preach in such a place; but if you dwell there, and the Lord has given you to know your Savior, then begin at once, wherever you may be, to gather people for edifying meetings and the reading of God’s Word. This is the first beginning toward the formation of a congregation.

There are congregations which have quickly gone under because this was neglected before the congregation was founded.

But above all, let us be careful that it is not the bitterness of party spirit which gathers the congregation instead of the love of Christ.
