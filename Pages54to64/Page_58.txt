STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – carries ecclesiological weight (congregation/church) not merely a gathering.
* "usynlig og synlig" – technical Lutheran distinction; must not be abstracted.
* "Lunkenhed", "Ligegyldighed" – spiritual tepidity/indifference, not mild apathy.
* "Statskirken" – historical-cultural reference to the state church system.
* "Stiftelse" – foundation/establishment with moral weight, not mere institution.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal chains and rhetorical pivots.
* Parallel biblical citations embedded mid-sentence.
* Frequent semicolon logic that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of visible/invisible church.
* Sacraments as means of grace.
* Blood-purchase imagery (atonement, ecclesiology).
* Hypocrisy vs. holiness in church membership.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Rebuke of spiritual pride and separatism.
* Warning against clerical indifference.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "En Daare siger i sit Hjerte" – Psalm 14 echo; KJV: "The fool hath said in his heart".
* "aabenbaret i Kjød" – Johannine/Incarnational language (John 1).
* "Bryllupsklædningen" – Matthew 22 parable.
* "ransage Hjerter og Nyrer" – Psalm/Revelation idiom; divine prerogative.
* Commercial metaphors (shops, names in a book) – critique of consumer-like church switching.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The visible and invisible church are one and the same.
* Rebuttal: Mockers deny the paradox.
* Practical danger: leads to indifference and withdrawal.
* Examples: the separatist layman; the indifferent pastor.
* Consequences: loss of souls, loss of laborers, loss of salt.
* Positive assertion: every congregation is God’s church, Christ’s body.
* Exhortation: seriousness, responsibility, repentance.
* Conclusion: preaching the true nature of the church restrains levity and indifference.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Colossians 3:3 – "Your life is hid with Christ in God".
* Matthew 5:16 – "Let your light so shine before men".
* Revelation 2–3 – Seven golden lampstands.
* Matthew 22 – Wedding garment.
* Psalm 7 / Revelation 2 – Searching hearts and reins.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings must remain sharp.
* Mockery and lukewarmness explicitly condemned.
* No softening of pastoral rebuke.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "skal" rendered as "must" / "shall".
* Moral necessity preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation/church (consistent choice).
* Blod = blood (atonement language retained).
* Vidne = witness.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Dust and shame vs. glory.
* Salt losing its savor.
* Lampstands.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity → pastoral hope.
* Rebuke → exhortation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where deliberate.
* Sermonic rhythm preserved.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

APD: Independent AI verification 

We will with all our might hold fast to this: that it is one and the same congregation which is invisible and visible; and we believe that this is of the utmost practical importance. We know well that the mockers say: a thing cannot be both visible and invisible; it must be two different things. A fool also says in his heart: There is no God. A fool also says: God is invisible; He cannot be manifested in the flesh. But the Word of God, which says, “Our life is hid with Christ in God,” the same Word also says: “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works.” Why do we emphasize this? Because this talk of a visible and an invisible congregation has, alas, become the cause of no small lukewarmness and indifference among us.

There is, for example, a man who belongs to no congregation; according to his own imagination he belongs to the fellowship of believers, but in a visible congregation he will not be, for it is so defiled, so unclean, so mixed. Thus he remains outside; it is not the visible congregation that matters—he does not go to church, he does not partake of the Sacrament; it is all unclean through its muddled state. Thus a soul is lost, and thus God’s congregation loses a laborer, because he would have the invisible congregation and its glory, but not the dust and shame of the visible.

There is a man who is a pastor in a congregation. He labors with the notion that the congregation which has called him as pastor is merely the visible congregation; the invisible congregation is another matter. His visible congregation is only an outward circle, outside of which perhaps one or another may be received into the invisible congregation by faith. Thus he becomes indifferent as to how the congregation appears; thus the congregation becomes indifferent toward itself; thus the salt through indifference and mockery loses its power—wherewith then shall it be salted?

No, this spirit of mockery and lukewarmness, which we all carry with us from the state church, must be cast out. We must give heed to this: that each individual congregation is God’s congregation; each individual congregation which is bought with Jesus’ blood; each individual congregation is one of the seven golden lampstands which John saw. Each of them shall be the manifestation of Christ’s body in the world. If this were to become truly alive to us, what earnestness and holy stirring would not come upon us all who are in the congregation, and what a heavy responsibility would fall upon us for the wretched condition which our sins have given to God’s congregation.

We know that we cannot search hearts and reins, and assuredly many will come in who do not have on the wedding garment; but should it then become so easy a matter for anyone to run about the shops in the city and change congregation by gathering the shop assistants’ names in a book, because he bought clothes in one place and flour in another and tobacco in a third? Many will assuredly come at the invitation, “Come, all!” and many will afterward be a shame to the congregation; but then perhaps one and another would pause and reflect, if it were so that to enter the congregation were the same as to say: “From now on I will be a witness of Jesus Christ; He has indeed bought me with His blood.”

No one can prevent hypocrisy; but a living preaching of the congregation’s true nature can, by God’s grace, nevertheless prevent much levity and indifference, both among pastors and among members of the congregation.
