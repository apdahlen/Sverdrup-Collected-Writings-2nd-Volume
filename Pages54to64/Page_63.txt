STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed – must retain ecclesial sense: congregation/church body, not generic community.
* Stiftelse / stiftet – founding/establishment with institutional and ecclesial weight.
* Misligheder – irregularities, improprieties; not merely mistakes.
* Gjenvordigheder – difficulties, adversities; older form requiring elevated diction.
* Verdensretfærdiggjørelse – doctrinally charged term (objective/world justification).
* Menighedsbevidsthed – congregational consciousness/self-understanding.
* Slaphed – laxity, not casual looseness.
* Ret – right/order/legitimacy; juridical-moral nuance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered causal clauses.
* Semicolon logic and concessive pivots.
* Sermonic progression that should not be broken into modern short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of Baptism and Absolution.
* World-justification vs personal faith.
* Nature of church membership and visible church.
* Distinction between natural man and regenerated life.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet pastoral Lutheran tone.
* Warnings against false comfort.
* Earnest gratitude toward divine providence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "banet Veien" – providential preparation; KJV resonance: "made a way".
* "sparet mange Gjenvordigheder" – spared many trials; echoes biblical thanksgiving.
* "det naturlige Menneske" – Pauline anthropology (1 Cor. 2:14).
* "tage Trøst af" – to take false comfort; spiritual self-deception.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Proper founding is essential for a congregation.
* Thanksgiving for God’s providence in America.
* First error: excessive laxity in admission (Wisconsin Synod critique).
* Doctrinal root of error: false view of Baptism/Absolution.
* Consequence: loss of congregational consciousness.
* Second error: excessive rigor (Elling Eielsen’s society).
* Resulting harm: false assurance and loss of seriousness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Providence and grace language (Ps. 127; Eph. 2).
* Natural man vs spiritual man (1 Cor. 2).
* Warning against outward assurance (Matt. 7:21–23).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp doctrinal critique.
* Preserve thanksgiving and warning without softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" and "kan" rendered as must/cannot.
* Necessity and consequence retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Stiftelse – founding/establishment.
* Verdensretfærdiggjørelse – justification of the world.
* Omvendelse – conversion.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Do not flatten ecclesial or anthropological imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Gratitude → warning → critique → sober conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentence flow and sermonic rhythm.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

APD: Independent AI verification 

The first thing, therefore, which is of importance for a congregation, is that it be founded in a right manner. And we must rejoice over the infinite grace of the Lord, who has so wondrously prepared the way for the establishment of the free congregation, so that it may truly be said that there are many congregations in all communions in America which have been spared many, many adversities, because there were few irregularities at the founding. It was indeed to be expected that the transition from a state church to a free church, even in the most favorable cases, must bring with it great difficulties; and we ought not to marvel if some must suffer much on account of their lack of understanding; yet there is in truth great cause to thank the Lord, because He has spared us as much as He has done.

That which has constituted the difficulty has naturally been this, that some have wished to receive too many, others too few. The Wisconsinites, who began by being Grundtvigians and therefore ascribed to Baptism a false significance, and who ended by preaching the justification of the world\footnote{universal Justification} and therefore ascribed to Absolution a false significance, have by their very doctrinal position been driven, quite naturally, to an extreme laxity in the founding of congregations. For it is precisely the same thing whether one places a Catholic significance in Baptism or in Absolution: one is thereby also necessarily driven, in practice, to follow a Catholic conception of the congregation. One may therefore be quite certain that where the justification of the world is preached, there the consciousness of the congregation lacks life and power to a high degree. We hope, however, that this is not often the case.

On the other hand, the Elling Society\footnote{The synod founded by the well-known layman Elling Eielsen, “The Evangelical Lutheran Church.” See also Collected Works I, 223. — Ed.} did indeed, in its time, go to the opposite extreme. The “old constitution” was assuredly not in full accord with the order of the Kingdom of God in this respect. There were indeed not especially great difficulties connected with being received into a congregation there, more than elsewhere; but the fault was this, that those who were received into the congregation were, by the very act of reception, stamped as “converted, or on the way of conversion,” and this naturally had a harmful influence upon the rightful standing of the congregation. For we all know how quickly the natural man is inclined to take comfort from all such outward things. And there is scarcely any doubt that several congregations, precisely through this delusion that they were Christians more so than other congregations, have lost no small measure of seriousness and sincerity.
