STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Stedsmenigheden" – carries ecclesiological weight; more than a local parish, implies a concrete gathered congregation.
* "Vækkelsen / de vakte" – technical pietistic terms; not generic revivalists but those awakened by the Spirit.
* "Frikirke" – not merely non‑state church, but a free, confessing congregation.
* "Massekristendom / Massemenighed" – polemical theological critique, not sociological jargon.
* "Udsondring" – biblical and ecclesial separation, not mere division.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extremely long, chained sentences with semicolon logic and cumulative force.
* Embedded quotations and rhetorical sighs that must retain cadence.
* Sermonic buildup that resists modern sentence fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrines of awakening, repentance, grace, spiritual life/death.
* Distinction between outward affiliation and inward regeneration.
* Role of the Spirit governing the congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest Lutheran-pietistic exhortation.
* Direct address to conscience.
* Polemical sharpness against hypocrisy and unbelief.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Min Sjæl dø disse retfærdiges Død" – echo of Numbers 23:10; KJV phrasing must be preserved.
* "Vækkelsen" – not emotionalism, but Spirit-wrought awakening.
* "Sværmeri og Galstab" – fanaticism and madness; polemical terms.
* "Herrens Time" – providentially appointed season (cf. John 7:6).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The time of Norwegian immigration coincided providentially with the ideal moment for forming a free church.
* Evidence: The unprecedented revival period in Norway.
* Broad impact: Nearly every family touched positively or negatively.
* Sorting effect: Genuine believers, admirers, hypocrites, and enemies revealed.
* Conclusion: Revival condemned mass Christianity and enabled a Spirit-governed free congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Numbers 23:10 – desire to die the death of the righteous.
* Johannine language of life in God.
* Pauline imagery of body with dead members.
* Separation motifs from Scripture.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against hypocrisy remain sharp.
* Condemnation of unbelieving mockery preserved.
* No softening of spiritual peril or judgment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maatte", "kunde", "vilde" rendered with necessity and divine appointment.
* No weakening of obligation or inevitability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Vækkelse → Awakening
* de vakte → the awakened
* Aand → Spirit
* Naade → grace
* Synd → sin

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery (dead members) retained.
* Movement imagery (stream, separation) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward unbelief.
* Sympathy toward the half-awakened.
* Hope even for dead members.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.
* Semicolons and parallel clauses maintained.

The Local Congregation.

It was altogether impossible to point to any “more convenient time” for the formation of a truly Free Church than that in which the Norwegians came to America. It is superfluous to remind the reader that the Norwegian Church, from the beginning of this century down to our own day, has experienced a season of awakening such as, so far as history knows, it has never had before. And however dark and dead it may unfortunately still be in many places among our people, there is yet scarcely a single family in the whole Norwegian nation that has not in one way or another come into contact with “the Awakening” or with “the awakened.” Some have been seized by the Spirit of God, and through deep distress over sin have learned to know the Saviour as their Saviour; others have gone along with the stream, and without themselves coming to any personal experience of the life in God, they have nevertheless acknowledged the Christianity of the awakened as a living fruit of the work of the Spirit, and many a time have they silently sighed within themselves: “Oh that I were as one of them! Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.” Though they have lacked full sincerity to experience both the depths of sin and the depths of grace, yet the Awakening has not passed them by altogether untouched. Some have also followed the awakened in hypocrisy, and these have unfortunately many times become such blemish of shame as have offended the children of God and have caused the name of God and the work of His Spirit to be blasphemed by the children of unbelief. Some have conceived a thorough, almost devilish hatred of this work of God, and they have not only mocked when the shame of the hypocrites was laid bare, but they have also called the movement toward God and the joy in the Lord fanaticism and madness. But almost no one has been able to gain complete footing in peace, wholly untouched by this mighty movement. Nearly all have in one way or another been either for it or against it.

But it is then an evident fact that such a time of decision as this was a peculiar hour of the Lord, which He Himself had chosen, that a free congregation might be formed which was permeated by a living consciousness of what faith in Christ and the Christian life are. It was an hour of the Lord in which a choice and a decision took place in so many hearts; and in such a time the setting apart could also occur which was necessary in order that the free congregation might be formed of those who would voluntarily confess Christ. Mass Christianity and the mass congregation were judged by the Awakening; and when the free congregation was formed, those who in their hearts hated and persecuted all living Christianity would naturally withdraw themselves. And thereby the self-governing congregation became able truly to be governed by the Spirit of Christ, even though it might number many dead members; for even these had yet, in a certain sense, bowed themselves under the Word of God, which many of them gladly wished might bow their hearts to a full knowledge of the truth, that they too might become children of God.
