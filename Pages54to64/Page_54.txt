STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Kirkesamfund” denotes an ecclesial body or church fellowship, not merely a denomination in the modern sense.
* “Menighed” carries the full theological sense of the gathered congregation as the Church in concreto.
* “Frie” applied to the Church implies spiritual freedom under Christ, not institutional autonomy alone.
* “Segl” (seal) bears biblical-sacramental resonance (ownership, divine ratification).
* “Strøget paa dens Dørstolper” evokes Passover blood imagery (Exodus 12).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long periodic sentences with multiple subordinate clauses must be preserved.
* Dashes function as rhetorical pauses, not mere punctuation.
* Parallel constructions (“stundom … stundom …”) must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Blood imagery refers explicitly to Christ’s atoning blood, not metaphorical suffering.
* “Kjøbt for Gud” reflects redemption theology (1 Cor. 6:20).
* “Brud” (bride) must preserve ecclesiological and eschatological meaning.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn pastoral gravity must not be softened.
* Experiential suffering is framed as formative, not merely emotional.
* The exhortational movement from experience to Scripture must remain explicit.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Det skrives ind i en Mands Hjerte” — idiom for indelible spiritual inscription (cf. Jer. 31:33).
* “Kostet Graad og Taarer” — echoes biblical lament language.
* “Søge tilbage til Guds eget Ord” — Reformation principle of sola Scriptura.
* “Det første og det sidste” — alpha/omega framing.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: Historical observation of Norwegian church life in America.
* Development: Painful and joyful experiences as formative schooling.
* Intensification: Costliness measured in relational rupture and tears.
* Theological pivot: Greater cost — Christ’s blood sealing the Church.
* Normative claim: God instructs His redeemed people through His Word.
* Methodological conclusion: Scripture first, experience second.
* Focus announced: The congregation as foundation and culmination.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Exodus 12 — blood on doorposts.
* 1 Peter 1:18–19 — redeemed by precious blood.
* Ephesians 5:25–27 — Church as the bride of Christ.
* Isaiah/Jeremiah — God instructing His people in the way.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain language of pain, rupture, and bitterness.
* Preserve contrast between human suffering and divine redemption.
* Avoid pastoral softening of conflict language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Har lært” / “ikke let glemmes” — must convey inevitability.
* “Har derfor ikke ladet” — strong divine intentionality.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Kirkesamfund = church body / ecclesial fellowship
* Blod = blood (never abstracted)
* Ord = Word (capitalized when divine)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* School of experience metaphor retained.
* Seal and blood imagery preserved literally.
* Bride imagery maintained without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical reflection → grave warning → theological consolation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Semicolon logic preserved.
* Rhythmic repetitions maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Congregation.

It is already a long time since the Norwegian church bodies began their activity in America, and there have already been many experiences during that time, both bitter and joyful; and the people have learned much in this school, which is not easily forgotten. For that which has cost weeping and tears, that which has many a time torn apart the tenderest bonds—at times between pastor and congregation, at times between brethren within the same congregation, at times between husband and wife, parents and children—that is written into a man’s heart in such a manner and with such bitter pain that it is not erased so long as there is yet life and breath.

But if these are exceedingly costly things, which no earnest man sets aside or passes over lightly, then there is a seal yet more costly which has been set upon God’s congregation: it is the blood that has been smeared upon its doorposts, the precious blood of Jesus Christ, by which it has been purchased for God to be His free, pure, undefiled Bride. And God has therefore not left His congregation without guidance in His holy Word; but the people whom He has obtained for Himself, these He also instructs concerning the way in which they are to walk.

Therefore, when we are to consider these matters, we must first trace back to God’s own Word, and thereafter we shall judge, insofar as it is possible for us, also the experiences that have already been made in America and the results to which the development has come. We shall begin with that which is first—and which is also last—in the church body: the congregation.
