STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" / "Menighedsstiftelse" carries ecclesiological weight (congregation as spiritual body, not mere organization).
* "Frivillighed" implies freedom of conscience, not casual voluntarism.
* "Nøde" (to compel/urge) echoes Luke 14:23; must not be rendered as coercion.
* "Skik og Brug" denotes social custom exerting pressure.
* "Kirketugt" and "Udstødelse" are technical Lutheran terms (church discipline, excommunication).
* "Forargelse" implies scandal in the Pauline sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, paratactic sentences with theological pivots.
* Parenthetical contrasts and concessive clauses must be preserved.
* Sermonic rhythm with cumulative argumentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between outward church membership and true spiritual life.
* Doctrine of Word and Spirit as sole legitimate means of gathering the Church.
* Proper understanding of baptism vis-à-vis living faith.
* Danger of church discipline when prematurely admitting members.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran pastoral tone.
* Direct address to conscience and clergy.
* Biblical exhortation must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Nøde dem til at gaa ind" – allusion to Luke 14:23 (KJV: "compel them to come in"); denotes loving, spiritual urgency, not force.
* "Bryllupsklædningen" – Matthew 22; fitness before God.
* "Staar udenfor" – Pauline ecclesial language.
* "Kristi Kjærlighed tvinger os" – 2 Corinthians 5:14 (KJV wording should be echoed).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening observation: voluntariness in American congregational foundations.
* Acknowledgment of mixed motives and social pressures.
* Assertion of proper voluntariness grounded in Christ’s command.
* Clarification of true "compulsion" as Word-centered persuasion.
* Warning against organizational methods apart from the Word.
* Critique of hasty admissions and dangers of church discipline.
* Conclusion: plea for Spirit-filled urgency and Pauline love.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 14:23 – "compel them to come in."
* Matthew 22 – wedding garment.
* Pauline ecclesiology (inside/outside).
* 2 Corinthians 5:14 – love of Christ constraining.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warnings about spiritual danger.
* Preserve pastoral gravity and urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "skal" rendered as "must" / "shall," not "should."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Guds Ord = Word of God
* Kirketugt = church discipline

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* House filling imagery.
* Sleep imagery for spiritual deadness.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Balance of concession, warning, exhortation, and prayer.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentence flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

APD: Independent AI verification 

It thus came almost as an uncomprehended gift to the congregations that were founded in America, that at the very establishment of the congregation there had to prevail so full a voluntariness as the conditions of human conditions nearly demand. It cannot indeed be denied that, despite the great separation wrought by the “Awakening” between “living Christians” and “dead children of the world,” and despite all the altered circumstances, yet in America also “custom and usage” worked very powerfully toward leading people to enter the congregation. It is likewise true that no Christian can think without sorrow of the many, many Norwegians who in the foreign land have altogether forsaken their Church, and that therefore those who earnestly desired to promote the welfare of the congregation were glad to have as many of their countrymen as possible within it. It must also be admitted that, both on the part of many pastors and of congregational members, there was an anxious fear concerning the pastor’s salary and the expenses, which led them to employ various unsatisfactory means in order to induce people to enter the congregation. And finally, the whole lonely condition in the foreign land naturally came in as a powerful incentive, urging men in every way to unite themselves together.

Yet it must be said that, as a rule, a full voluntariness prevailed in the founding of congregations. It is the Lord’s command that we shall “compel them to come in,” and it is therefore not our task to investigate whether those who enter have on the wedding garment or not. The Lord Himself will examine that in His own time. But the “compulsion” of which the Lord speaks is not any sort of outward constraint; rather it is as when a kindly man urges a foreign traveler to lodge in his house by showing such friendliness that it becomes impossible to refuse his invitation. We must say that just as important as it is that there be full freedom in the founding of a congregation, so necessary it is that there be a truly earnest “compelling to come in” through the Word of God. It must be the Word that gathers a congregation.

Even among the Norwegian emigrants, who indeed all were once received into God’s Church through baptism, it would have been far better if one had never organized any congregation or gathered congregational members in any other way or by any other means than through the preaching of the Word of God, publicly and privately. For even baptized persons are many times, alas, in such a condition that it is better both for themselves and for the congregation that they “stand without” and are the object of the congregation’s influence in that way, than that they be within and perhaps there sleep the deepest sleep, precisely because they are “in the congregation.” Many times, too, overly hasty admissions into the congregation have soon brought about manifest scandal within it, and then one has had to resort to church discipline and exclusion; and as necessary as this means is, we nevertheless know, alas, that its application is bound up with such great dangers both for the congregation that disciplines and for the one who is disciplined, that in many cases and in many congregations it would be better if one could avoid it.

We therefore lay the greatest weight upon this: that the congregation must be gathered by the Word of God, and that the Word’s urging, drawing, and entreating is the only thing that shall be used to bring people into the congregation. If God’s Spirit is permitted to work this purpose in a man, that he desires admission into the congregation, then he is a true increase of the congregation, even if he has not yet come to the peace of faith with God; without this, he is only a diminution of the congregation’s true strength. We will here only add that there is far from everywhere that faithfulness in “compelling them to come in” which there ought to be. There is a dreadful lack of this, that all pastors and all congregational members in this respect can say with Paul, “The love of Christ constraineth us,” to bear forth the testimony of Christ’s death before all without distinction. May the Lord send us, in all our church bodies and in all our congregations, many true crying voices that compel them to come in, so that the Lord’s house may be filled.
