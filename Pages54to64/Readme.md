## About this section

This folder contains a page-anchored translation of pages 54–64 of Georg Sverdrup’s *Om Menigheden*, preserving the original pagination for citation and scholarly reference.

This section presents Sverdrup’s ecclesiology (doctrine of the Church) — his understanding of what the Christian congregation (*menighed*) is, how it exists, and how it ought to be formed within Norwegian-American Free Church life.

Sverdrup argues that the Church is simultaneously **invisible and visible**: invisible as the communion of saints whose life is hidden with Christ in God, and visible as the concrete gathering of believers through the Word and the Sacraments. These are not two different churches, but two aspects of the same reality. Every local congregation is therefore truly the Church of God in that place.

He warns against separating these dimensions. Treating the Church as only invisible leads to withdrawal and indifference; treating it as only visible leads to formalism and coercion. The Church lives in the tension between divine holiness and human frailty, bearing both Christ’s glory and the marks of sin.

Sverdrup insists that congregations must be formed freely through the Word of God, not by social pressure, party spirit, or institutional force. The congregation is gathered by preaching, confession, and spiritual conviction, not by outward compulsion.

He critiques both mass-membership without spiritual seriousness and sectarian exclusivism. Both distort the nature of the Church and undermine its witness.

Overall, this section explains how the Christian congregation functions as the living, visible presence of Christ’s body in the world — spiritually grounded, ethically serious, and shaped by grace rather than power.
