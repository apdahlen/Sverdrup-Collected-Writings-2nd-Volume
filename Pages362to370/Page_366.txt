STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedningemission" – carries 19th‑century ecclesial usage (mission to the heathen/Gentiles) without pejorative modern sense.
* "Hjemmemission" – domestic/home mission within the national church, not private evangelism.
* "Menigheden" – congregation/church as living body, not mere local assembly.
* "Liv" – theological life (divine/spiritual life), not biological existence.
* "Frelse / frelse / frelste" – salvation in full soteriological sense.
* "Sandheds Erkjendelse" – biblical-theological knowledge of truth, not abstract cognition.
* "Opreisning af Faldet" – restoration from the Fall; heavy Augustinian/Lutheran weight.
* "Samfund" – communion/fellowship, not social organization.
* "Formaal" – telos/purpose, not pragmatic goal.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with semicolon logic and cumulative clauses.
* Repeated causal chains introduced by "thi" and "og" that must not be flattened.
* Rhetorical emphasis through repetition (life, will, purpose).
* Sermonic pacing intended for oral proclamation.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between churchly power and divine life.
* Doctrine of divine will (revealed vs. eternal counsel).
* Christology: incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension ordered to salvation.
* Ecclesiology: the Church as Christ’s body participating in His mission.
* Soteriology: perseverance of life through participation in mission.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Polemical restraint: firm but not triumphalist.
* Danger of modern softening of warnings (life or death).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Guds Rige skal blive udbredt over al Jorden" – biblical idiom (cf. Ps. 67; Matt. 28).
* "samles af alle Folkeslag under Himlen" – echo of eschatological ingathering (Rev. 7).
* "vinde Magt" vs. "bevare Livet" – contrast between worldly dominion and spiritual vitality.
* "bære Livets Frugt" – Johannine imagery (John 15).
* "drikke af denne evige Kjærligheds Kilde" – metaphor of grace as living water (John 4; 7).
* "sidder i Dødens Mørke" – Isaianic/Lukan phrase (Isa. 9; Luke 1:79).
* KJV provides natural equivalents for kingdom, fruit, body, will, light/darkness.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Evangelical mission is not for ecclesial domination but for the spread of God’s kingdom and salvation of souls.
* Clarification: This neither diminishes nor inflates mission’s importance; it defines it rightly.
* Doctrinal claim: The Church’s concern is life, not power.
* Grounding: The Church shares in God’s life and must preserve and bear its fruit.
* Necessity: Participation in mission is required to preserve this life.
* Divine basis: God’s eternal counsel and revealed will desire the salvation of all.
* Ecclesial participation: God fulfills this will through the Church’s mission.
* Christological foundation: Christ’s entire work aims at seeking and saving the lost.
* Ethical demand: Christ commands His disciples to participate.
* Climactic warning: Obedience to mission is a matter of life or death for the Church.
* Conclusion: Love for Christ is preserved only by loving those for whom He died.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Tim. 2:4 – God wills all to be saved and come to knowledge of truth.
* Luke 19:10 – The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
* John 15 – Life, abiding, and fruit-bearing.
* Rom. 12; Eph. 1 – Eternal counsel and will of the Father.
* Eph. 1–4; Col. 1 – Church as the body of Christ.
* 2 Cor. 5:14–15 – He died for all, that they who live should live unto Him.
* Isa. 9; Luke 1:79 – Darkness and shadow of death.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings about life and death must remain explicit.
* Exhortational force toward obedience must be retained.
* No sentimental softening of divine love or mission.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / necessity rendered as "must" or "is required".
* Commands of Christ rendered unequivocally.
* Conditional vitality (can only be preserved by…) kept strong.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Liv – Life (capitalized where theological).
* Menigheden – the Church / the congregation (consistent as the Church).
* Frelse – salvation.
* Vilje / Raad – will / counsel.
* Formaal – purpose.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fruit-bearing, drinking from a fountain, body imagery preserved.
* Darkness/light contrast retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From clarification → exhortation → warning → consolatory grounding in Christ’s love.
* No leveling of emotional intensity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically necessary.
* Semicolon and cumulative clause structure preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Not so among us; the evangelical mission to the heathen and the home mission are not carried on in order that the Church might become world‑ruling, but in order that the Kingdom of God might be spread over all the earth, and that saved souls might be gathered from all peoples under heaven.

And thereby mission does not receive less significance for the Church, but rather greater. For in the evangelical Church it is not a question of winning power, but far more of preserving life and bearing the fruit of life.

God’s Church has been made a partaker of God’s life, and it is this which is at issue—to preserve it and to bear fruit from it. And to this end it is also necessary to take part in mission; for it is indeed God’s eternal counsel of salvation and His revealed will that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. And this eternal will is carried out through the Church’s work of mission; and the Church is only then truly permeated by the Father’s eternal counsel and heart, when it is filled with zeal for the raising up of the human race from the Fall and for its return to the Father’s blessed communion. It is a matter of life for the Church to drink from this fountain of eternal love, and, strengthened thereby, to do the work of God.

And the Father’s will has first and foremost been realized in the world through the Son. His life and work, His suffering and death, His resurrection and ascension, all have this one purpose: to seek and to save that which was lost. And this which was lost is the whole sinful human race, and each individual sinner within it. And not only is it Jesus’ purpose to save the fallen race; it is also His command to all His disciples that they are to take part in this work. Being themselves saved, they are to labor for the salvation of others through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And for the Church it is therefore a question of life or death when it comes to the question of being obedient to the command or not. He who died for all, that all should live, He wills that His body, which is the Church, should work toward the attainment of His purpose and the realization of His will. He who himself lives upon the ground of Christ’s death can preserve this life in strength and freshness only by bringing the Gospel of Christ’s cross out to those who sit in the darkness of death; for the love of Christ is preserved only in love toward those for whom He died.
