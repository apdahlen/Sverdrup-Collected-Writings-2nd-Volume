STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Sag" (matter/case) with formal, juridical-theological weight.
* "Hedenskab" (heathenism/paganism) as a spiritual-religious category, not merely cultural.
* "Grundsandheder" (fundamental truths) with confessional force.
* "Forsoning" (atonement/reconciliation) must retain soteriological precision.
* "Herlighedens Haab" (hope of glory) is Pauline and eschatological.
* "Ensfoldighed" here means simplicity/uniformity of understanding, not naïveté.
* "Endrægtighed" (concord/unity of spirit).
* "Hjord" and "Hyrde" are Johannine pastoral metaphors.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, periodic sentences with layered causal clauses.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation must be preserved.
* Sermonic rhythm with parallel lists (e.g., doctrinal terms) should not be broken.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrines of atonement, forgiveness, faith, spiritual life, eschatological hope.
* Ecclesiology: unity of the Church versus denominational differences.
* Sacramental theology: baptism, Gospel, Lord’s Supper as means of communion.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran tone addressing the conscience of the Church.
* Moral urgency where Christianity and paganism meet in a life-and-death struggle.
* Risk of flattening solemnity by modernizing diction.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kamp paa Liv og Død" – a life-and-death struggle; spiritual warfare imagery.
* "redde Sjæle fra Døden" – salvation language echoing James 5:20.
* "trængt tilbage" – pressed into the background, not erased.
* "én Hjord under én Hyrde" – John 10:16 (KJV resonance required).
* Quotation: Colossians 3:11 – must align closely with KJV phrasing.
* "frigjøre den fra de Baand" – emancipation imagery, spiritual bondage.
* "I er alle Brødre" – Matthew 23:8, ecclesial brotherhood.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Mission brings Christianity into decisive conflict with heathenism, elevating core gospel truths.
* Claim 1: In such contexts, secondary evangelical differences recede.
* Result: Greater simplicity of understanding and concord among Christians.
* Claim 2: Mission relativizes external divisions, moving the Church toward Christ’s goal of one flock.
* Claim 3: Mission corrects the Church’s distorted relationship to nationality and race.
* Means: Shared life in baptism, Gospel, and Lord’s Supper.
* Conclusion: The Church is freed into the worldwide brotherhood of God’s kingdom.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 10:16 – one flock, one shepherd.
* Colossians 3:11 – neither Greek nor Jew, etc.
* Matthew 23:8 – all brethren.
* Implicit Pauline ecclesiology and missiology throughout.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain uncompromising seriousness about salvation and spiritual death.
* Preserve exhortational confidence in mission’s purifying power.
* Avoid sentimental language; keep moral gravity intact.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity expressed by "nødvendigvis" must remain unequivocal.
* Teleological certainty in "jo mere… desto" constructions must be preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forsoning → atonement
* Syndsforladelse → forgiveness of sins
* Tro → faith
* aandeligt Liv → spiritual life
* Menighed → congregation/church (contextually consistent)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Bonds/bands of nationality as shackles.
* Flock/shepherd imagery retained verbatim.
* Brotherhood as lived, communal reality.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in diagnosis of division and prejudice.
* Hopeful elevation toward unity and brotherhood.
* Final confession marked by humble aspiration.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long, flowing sentences suited for proclamation.
* Preserve parallelisms and accumulative clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

There is another matter which stands in close connection with this; where Christianity and heathenism meet in a struggle of life and death, or where it is a question of rescuing souls from death, the Christian fundamental truths concerning atonement, forgiveness of sins, faith, spiritual life, and the hope of glory become so overwhelmingly important that the differences which exist among evangelical Christians are necessarily pushed back into a more subordinate position; and this prepares the way for a simpler understanding within the congregation and a corresponding greater concord among Christians with one another. And the more this inner, spiritual unity is fostered and advanced, the less significance do the outward separations and associations assume, so that we move ever nearer toward the goal which the Lord has set for His own upon earth: that they, gathered into congregations each in its own place, yet together constitute but one flock under one Shepherd.

Furthermore, the work of missions will place the congregation in its right relation to the question of nationality and race, and will set it free from the bonds by which it is bound in this respect. The truth which the Word of God sets forth—“Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all, and in all”—has indeed been so grievously thrust back in the consciousness of the congregation. But mission will once more bring it forward and make it living for us through the fellowship in Baptism, the Gospel, and the Lord’s Supper.

Through the living and spiritual participation in the work and conflict of the Kingdom of God, the congregation will be delivered from the bonds of the nationalities with their partiality, injustice, and hatred. And freed from these wretched pettinesses, the congregation will feel the liberation which lies in the world-embracing brotherhood of the Kingdom of God. We shall learn—though but little by little and late—to stammer forth that glorious confession: Here there is neither black nor white, Norwegian nor Swedish, German nor Danish, Englishman nor American; but here is the eternal fellowship of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: “You are all brother.”
