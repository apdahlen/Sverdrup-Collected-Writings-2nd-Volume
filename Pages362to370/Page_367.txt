STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden: not merely “congregation” sociologically, but the gathered body of believers as a spiritual organism.
* Drift (of the Holy Spirit): more than inclination; an inner divine compulsion or urging.
* Brøde: grave sin or offense against God, with juridical and moral weight.
* Frelse: salvation in its full biblical sense, not mere rescue or well-being.
* Trældom / Frihed: theological bondage vs. evangelical freedom.
* Kraft: spiritual power, vitality, not mere efficiency.
* Hengivelse: wholehearted consecration or self-surrender.
* Frelsesraad: the eternal counsel or plan of salvation of the Triune God.
* Erobringsrige: conquest-kingdom, militant expansion of God’s reign.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with causal and conditional clauses that must retain sermonic flow.
* Rhetorical questions functioning as moral confrontation.
* Parallel constructions linking church and mission reciprocally.
* Metaphorical argument developed over several sentences (leaven, army).

Theological Hazards:

* Resisting the Holy Spirit as a biblically grave sin.
* Relationship between church obedience, mission, and divine judgment.
* The doctrine of God’s kingdom as active, advancing, and conquering.
* Corporate responsibility of congregations within the one Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, warning tone must not be softened.
* Judicial and military metaphors must remain vivid.
* Appeals to conscience and responsibility must retain urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “at modstaa den Helligaand” echoes Acts 7:51; must retain biblical gravity.
* Jewish rejection of Christ and hindering Gentiles recalls Romans 9–11 and Acts.
* “vandre paa deres Vei” – idiom for moral imitation leading to judgment.
* “ikke være os Trældom men Frihed” resonates with John 8:36 and Galatians.
* Leaven metaphor directly from Matthew 13:33 (KJV diction appropriate).
* Military language (army, troops, soldiers, victory) echoes Pauline imagery (Ephesians 6).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation must follow not only Christ’s command but also the Spirit’s urging in mission.
* Warning: Resisting the Holy Spirit leads to judgment, as seen in Israel’s history.
* Appeal: Obedience brings freedom, not bondage.
* Doctrinal claim: Full vitality of church life requires harmony with God’s saving counsel in history.
* Reciprocal argument: Church strengthens mission; mission strengthens church.
* Metaphorical proof: Leaven and conquest imagery.
* Conclusion: Corporate and individual responsibility within the Church determines victory.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 7:51 – resisting the Holy Spirit.
* Matthew 23; Romans 10–11 – Israel hindering salvation.
* Matthew 13:33 – the leaven of the kingdom.
* Ephesians 6; 1 Corinthians 12 – army/body imagery and mutual dependence.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings retained without mitigation.
* Rhetorical questions translated forcefully.
* Corporate guilt and responsibility clearly articulated.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* maa = must / must needs.
* uundgaaeligt = inevitable, unavoidable.
* skal = shall (not mere future, but moral certainty).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden = the congregation.
* Frelse = salvation.
* Guds Rige = the Kingdom of God.
* Kraft = power.
* Arbeide = work (with theological weight).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Leaven metaphor preserved without explanation.
* Military imagery retained fully.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity (warning) contrasted with freedom and encouragement.
* Judgment vs. hope held in tension.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon logic maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

And the congregation does not merely need to obey Christ’s command concerning mission; in this matter it must also follow the drive of the Holy Spirit. It is dangerous to resist the Holy Spirit. We know well that the Jewish people made themselves guilty of this treaspass. They would not themselves believe in Christ; neither would they permit the Gentiles to believe in Him. In every way they sought to hinder salvation from reaching the hearts of men. We see their judgment and punishment before our eyes; shall we walk in their path? No—when God’s Spirit urges us to seek salvation for ourselves and to labor for the salvation of others, then let us follow the call, and God’s will and His work shall not be bondage to us but freedom.

It is not difficult in this way to recognize that the congregation does not attain full power in its life, nor complete devotion to its calling, until in the work for the spread of God’s Kingdom it comes into harmony with the saving counsel of the Triune God and its execution in the history of the human race.

And if we consider the very nature of the Kingdom and the manner in which it grows, we shall soon see that just as the congregation has great significance for mission, so also mission has great significance for the congregation.

Jesus has compared the Kingdom of God to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened. If it now appears that the meal is not leavened, it is unavoidable to ask whether the leaven has been sound. And if it appears that the evangelization of the heathen world proceeds slowly, it becomes a natural question whether there is the proper power in the congregation. In other words, where mission is weak, there responsibility inevitably returns to the congregation.

The Kingdom of God is, as we have seen above, a kingdom of conquest. If it does not advance in victory, the question is raised whether the army is awake and active. Necessarily, a vigorous missionary work must contribute to keeping the congregation watchful and militant. And each individual congregation is a troop within the great army as a whole, and we all know that the welfare and progress of the whole depend upon the strength and endurance of each small part. The congregations are therefore responsible first and foremost to God, but thereafter also to one another in this connection. If Christ’s work is to be carried out and victory won along the entire line, then the faithfulness of each individual soldier and each individual troop in battle and labor is decisive. Nothing sharpens the sense of responsibility more than lively participation in the great common work of all Christendom. And nothing can be more beneficial for the congregation than precisely this sharpened sense of responsibility.
