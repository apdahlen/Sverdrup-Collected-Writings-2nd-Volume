## Overview

This repository contains an English translation of “The Significance of Mission for the Church,” a theological address associated with the 100th Anniversary Assembly of the Lutheran Church (1906). The section appears in the original proceedings on pages 362–370. The text represents Scandinavian Lutheran ecclesiology and missiology in an early twentieth-century register, shaped by biblical argument and sermon-like exhortation.

## What the Text Argues

The address contends that mission is not an optional undertaking of the Church, but an essential manifestation of the Church’s spiritual life.

Major themes include:

* The Church as God’s work and deed, founded by the sending of the Holy Spirit and grounded in Christ’s death and resurrection.
* Mission as the Church’s necessary outflow: the Gospel is entrusted to the congregation in order to shine “at home and abroad,” not to be preserved as a dead treasure.
* The Kingdom of God as a peaceful yet victorious conquest, advancing through the Gospel rather than coercion.
* The reciprocal relationship between mission and congregational vitality: where mission is weak, responsibility returns to the congregation; where mission is vigorous, the congregation is kept watchful, responsible, and spiritually awake.
* A sharp contrast between the living congregation (self-giving love, obedience, service for souls’ salvation) and the dead congregation (self-interest, party-spirit, outward welfare and power).
* Mission’s capacity to relativize national, racial, and confessional boundaries by recovering the Church’s world-embracing fellowship in Baptism, Gospel, and the Lord’s Supper.
* The final synthesis of home mission and foreign mission as sharing one root, one Spirit, and one necessity for the Church.

## Translation Principles

This translation aims to preserve:

* semantic fidelity and doctrinal precision
* the original argument structure
* sermonic cadence and rhetorical contrasts
* recognizable biblical echoes in a dignified, KJV-tilted register without artificial archaism

The goal is an English rendering suitable for scholarly use while retaining the gravity and exhortational force of the original.
