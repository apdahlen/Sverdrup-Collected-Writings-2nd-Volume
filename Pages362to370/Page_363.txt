STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Aand” (Spirit): must be rendered as “Spirit,” with clear Trinitarian and personal force, not as an impersonal influence.
* “virksom”: not merely “active” in a general sense, but efficacious, operative, effectual.
* “Gjerning”: carries moral and theological weight; must not be reduced to neutral “work.”
* “Drift”: denotes an inward, Spirit-wrought impulse or compulsion, not mere inclination.
* “Menighed”: ecclesial term meaning the Church or congregation as a spiritual body.
* “Forsoning”: atonement/reconciliation with full substitutionary and universal scope implied.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sentences with causal connectors (“thi,” “derfor,” “fordi”) that must be preserved.
* Parallel clauses and cumulative argumentation that should not be fragmented.
* Embedded scriptural reasoning, especially Pauline logic, must retain its structure.

Theological Hazards:

* Universal scope of Christ’s death (“for alle”) must not be weakened.
* Relationship between Spirit, love, mission, and church life must remain doctrinally clear.
* Distinction between Spirit-produced necessity and human moral choice.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, exhortational Lutheran tone must not be softened.
* Appeals to conscience and necessity (“maa,” “tvinger”) must retain force.
* Avoid modern psychological or voluntaristic language.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Guds Aand er ikke virksom der, hvor han bor”: means the Spirit cannot be inactive where He indwells.
* “Kjærlighedens Gjerning”: echoes biblical love as active, sacrificial service.
* “samle dem ind til Faderen i Himlen”: biblical ingathering motif (John 11:52).
* “Kristi Kjærlighed tvinger dem”: direct echo of 2 Corinthians 5:14 (KJV: “the love of Christ constraineth us”).
* “søge at vinde Mennesker”: missionary idiom; not persuasion only, but spiritual winning.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Spirit of God is necessarily active and productive where He dwells.
* Support: Biblical examples (Samson; Jerusalem congregation).
* Doctrinal grounding: Spirit pours out God’s universal love based on Christ’s death for all.
* Consequence: Believers are compelled toward mission.
* Ecclesial conclusion: Mission is an essential life-expression of the Church.
* Experiential confirmation: Early disciples’ witness.
* Final universal claim: True possession of Spirit, joy, and love necessarily issues in witness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Samson and the Spirit – Judges 14–16.
* Pentecost congregation – Acts 2.
* Love of God poured out – Romans 5:5.
* Christ died for all – 2 Corinthians 5:14–15.
* Finding the Messiah and bringing others – John 1:41–46.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain strong assertions of necessity and impossibility.
* Preserve exhortational and declarative tone.
* Avoid any moderating language that weakens urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa” → “must.”
* “tvinger” → “constrains/compels.”
* “kan ingen” → “there can be none.”

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand → Spirit
* Kjærlighed → Love
* Menighed → Church
* Forsoning → Atonement
* Frelse / Salighed → Salvation / Blessedness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve imagery of outpouring, burning zeal, inward compulsion.
* Maintain bodily and organic metaphors (Body, Head).

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Maintain shifts between doctrinal exposition and experiential appeal.
* Preserve movement from assertion to rhetorical questioning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences with rhythmic balance.
* Preserve parallel constructions suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

But the Spirit of God is not idle where He dwells. He is the power of the living God, which ever drives those in whom He is found unto all good and God-pleasing works. As Samson was seized by the Spirit and driven by the Spirit to mighty deeds of power, so also that little flock in the upper room in Jerusalem was seized by the Spirit to carry out the great work of love among men: to gather them in unto the Father in heaven, and to unite them into one body with Jesus Christ Himself as Head and Lord.

For the Spirit is He by whom the love of God is poured out into the hearts of those who believe on Jesus the crucified. And since the love of God is world-embracing, Christ’s death is also for all, and an atonement for the sins of the whole world. Therefore it also comes to pass with those who believe on the crucified Saviour that the love of Christ constrains them to seek to win men, inasmuch as they judge this, that if One died for all, then were all dead; and that He died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him who died and rose again for them.

Since, then, the Church has been brought forth by the Spirit of God upon the foundation of Christ’s death for all, therefore the Church, from its spiritual birth, bears within itself this inward impulse, that it must “seek to win men” by spreading among them the testimony of God’s world-embracing love and the salvation which He has prepared for all peoples. Therefore missionary zeal is not merely a virtue among other Christian virtues, more or less necessary for the believer; but it is an essential and peculiar manifestation of life of the Spirit of God in and through the Church.

Or can we forget the effect which the love of Christ had upon those disciples of the Baptist, who, when they had found the Messiah, must also find their brethren and friends and lead them to Him? There can be none who has the Spirit of truth and does not burn with zeal to bear witness to the truth; there can be none who has the joy in Christ and does not desire to share it with others; there can be none who has the love of God poured out in his heart and does not feel the inward compulsion to labour for the salvation and blessedness of all.
