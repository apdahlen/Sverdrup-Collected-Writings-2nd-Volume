STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Missionens Betydning" – not merely practical mission work, but theological significance for the Church’s being.
* "Menigheden" – must be rendered consistently as "the Church" or "the congregation"; ecclesiological weight favors "the Church."
* "Ild" – metaphorical fire with biblical resonance (judgment, purification, Spirit).
* "støbt" – metaphor of casting/founding on a firm ground; not casual building language.
* "Værk" / "Gjerning" – divine action; must not be flattened into generic activity.
* "Talsmand" – Johannine term (Paraclete); doctrinally loaded.
* "evindelig" – eternal duration, not merely long-lasting.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal clauses beginning with "Thi" (For).
* Parallel negations and affirmations that must remain balanced.
* Embedded biblical citations that should not be modernized or broken apart.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as divine creation, not human association.
* Pneumatology: indwelling, permanence, and divine origin of the Spirit.
* Relation between Christ’s death/resurrection and the Church’s foundation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, declarative Lutheran tone.
* Polemical edge against reductionist ecclesiology.
* Exhortational gravity must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kaste Ild paa Jorden" – Luke 12:49; eschatological and spiritual ignition.
* "Liv var ikke spildt" / "Død var ikke forgjæves" – emphatic negation underscoring divine purpose.
* "Flodtunger" – Pentecost imagery; must echo Acts 2 and KJV diction ("cloven tongues like as of fire").
* "bo hos de troende" – indwelling presence; Johannine and Pauline overlap.
* KJV offers strong parallels: Luke 12:49; Acts 2; 1 Corinthians 3:16.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis grounded in Christ’s longing (Luke 12:49).
* Fulfillment claim: Christ’s life and death were effective.
* Ecclesiological clarification: Church not humanly formed.
* Pneumatological grounding: Pentecost as divine action.
* Doctrinal conclusion: Church as Spirit’s dwelling on earth.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 12:49 explicitly quoted.
* Acts 2:1–4 paraphrased (tongues of fire, Jerusalem, upper room).
* John 14–16: Paraclete promises.
* 1 Corinthians 3:16 quoted.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain declarative certainty.
* Retain contrast between human and divine origin.
* Preserve solemn affirmation of fulfillment and permanence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" – must retain future necessity ("was to," "should").
* "var ikke" – absolute negation retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden = the Church.
* Aanden = the Spirit.
* Guds Aand = the Spirit of God.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fire imagery preserved.
* Casting/founding metaphor preserved.
* Temple/dwelling imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From longing → fulfillment → doctrinal instruction → scriptural testimony.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Periodic structure preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

3. The Significance of Mission for the Church

[Source: Account of the 100th Anniversary Assembly of the Lutheran Church, 1906, pp. 91–102. — Ed.]

“I am come to cast fire upon the earth; and how gladly would I that it were already kindled!” Luke 12:49.

This sigh of longing from the heart of Jesus has been fulfilled. His life was not spent in vain, and His death was not without purpose. The fire was cast upon the earth when the Spirit was sent and the Church was founded upon the unshakable foundation of Christ’s death and resurrection.

For the Church is not simply an association formed by the first Christians after Jesus had ascended into heaven. It is God’s work and His deed, an essential part of God’s revelation among men, and therefore an object of that faith which does not arise from human understanding, but from the Spirit of God. The tongues of fire which descended upon those who were gathered in the upper room in Jerusalem, when the Spirit from God came upon them, did not spring from the hearts of the disciples and were not the expression of a human fevor within them; the flames were kindled from heaven and were the expression of the Spirit’s light and warmth, which henceforth were to dwell with the believers.

For the Spirit was not given in order that He should again depart from the disciples. He was the new Advocate whom Jesus had promised to His own, the Spirit of truth and of love, who was to abide with them forever. Therefore the Church is not only the work and creation of the Spirit, but it is also the Spirit’s dwelling upon earth, according to the testimony which Paul bears to the Church: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”
