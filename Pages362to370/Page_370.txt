STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Mission" includes home mission and foreign (heathen) mission, not merely overseas work.
* "Menighed" signifies the living congregation/church as a spiritual body, not a parish institution.
* "Indremission" vs. "Hjemmemission" carry specific 19th-century Scandinavian ecclesial meanings.
* "Redningsarbeide" bears soteriological weight—work of rescue of souls.
* "Erkjendelse" implies spiritual apprehension/knowledge, not mere cognition.
* "Selvhengivelsen" denotes self-surrender/self-offering in a sacrificial sense.
* "Hvedekorn" alludes to Johannine imagery (John 12:24).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological pivots must not be broken excessively.
* Sermonic parallelisms (dead vs. living congregation) require balance.
* Embedded biblical quotation (Great Commission) must retain formal cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinctions between living/free vs. dead congregation are doctrinally sharp.
* Mission as church-forming (ecclesiological claim) must remain explicit.
* Sacrificial language (offering, altar, blood) must not be softened.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational tone addressing conscience and brethren.
* Warning against self-love and party-spirit.
* Earnest pastoral urgency at the close.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Gaar hen og gjør alle Folk til Discipler" — direct echo of Matthew 28:19–20; KJV phrasing is natural.
* "arbeider for sin egen ydre Velfærd" — idiom of worldly self-preservation vs. spiritual life.
* "Hvedekorn, som lægges i Jorden" — John 12:24; death unto fruitfulness.
* "Smertemes og Kjærlighedens Mand" — echo of Isaiah 53 (Man of Sorrows).
* "Det ske, det ske" — liturgical repetition, akin to prayerful assent.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Clarification: Mission discussed is not merely external/foreign.
* Definition: Mission’s goal is formation of a self-edifying Christian congregation.
* Distinction: Inner mission as rescue work, related but different.
* Unity: Home and heathen mission share root, spirit, necessity.
* Scriptural warrant: One command from the Lord for all peoples.
* Exhortation: Participation in mission marks the living congregation.
* Contrast: Dead vs. living congregation.
* Consolation and hope: Self-giving leads to divine fruitfulness.
* Doxological conclusion and prayer.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 28:18–20 — Great Commission.
* John 12:24 — Grain of wheat dying to bear much fruit.
* Romans 12:1 — Living, holy, acceptable sacrifice.
* Isaiah 53 — Man of Sorrows.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp contrasts and solemn warnings.
* Preserve pastoral urgency and earnest appeal.
* Retain sacrificial and suffering imagery without dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan det siges" — rendered as firm moral conclusion, not suggestion.
* "ingen kan vurdere ... for høit" — absolute statement retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed — congregation.
* Mission — mission.
* Kjærlighed — love (charitable, self-giving).
* Offer — sacrifice/offering.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Grain of wheat metaphor retained verbatim.
* Altar and bread imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning against dead congregation.
* Elevation toward hope, prayer, and doxology.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and semicolon turns.
* Maintain proclamation rhythm.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Perhaps some may think that we have had chiefly the outward mission in mind when we have here spoken of mission and its significance for the congregation. This, however, is not the case. We have here in our circumstances both home mission and heathen mission. For the goal of mission is the founding of a congregation, whether it be carried on at home or abroad. Mission has reached its goal where the congregation independently takes up Christian work of edification. What in Europe is called inner mission is another branch of the congregation’s activity, which one has in part with greater justice called rescue work. Both home mission and heathen mission spring from the same root, are driven by the same Spirit, are equally necessary for the congregation, and have at least in part the same value and significance for its spiritual insight and life.

For our own people and for all peoples alike we have the one and the same command from the Lord: Go ye therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. There is no difference. And no one can value too highly the significance of obedience to the Lord and to His command.

And therefore it may at last be said as a solemn admonition to us all: heartfelt and vigorous participation in the work of mission at home and abroad is an essential mark of the living and free congregation. The dead congregation bears the mark of self-interest; it labors for its own outward welfare, for it knows no inward; it labors for itself and its party, its outward greatness and power. The living congregation works in the self-sacrificing service of love for the salvation of souls, for the spreading of the kingdom of God, for the glory of God and the advance of His Gospel. Even though small and insignificant, it exalts its Savior through self-surrender; and in the unshakable certainty that when it gives up its life in the service of God, then it wins it; and when it becomes a grain of wheat that is laid in the earth, then it springs forth into abundant harvest for the Lord.

May it be granted to us, brethren, even in great frailty, to set forth God’s living and free congregation among men, and to set forth ourselves in and through it as a living, holy, and God-pleasing sacrifice.

So be it, so be it, for Jesus’ sake! Bloodied and torn does the sacrificial bread appear upon the altar; yet if it be thus received by the Lord, the suffering and bleeding heart shall indeed find courage for every lack and healing for every pain with Him who Himself is the Man of Sorrows and of love, Jesus, our forever highly praised Savior. Amen.
