STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Sag" – carries weight of a grave matter or cause, not merely an issue.
* "Menighed" – theological community (congregation/church body), not generic assembly.
* "Erobringshær" – metaphor of conquest with biblical-military resonance.
* "Hedenskabet" – paganism with strong theological judgment.
* "Verdslighed" – worldliness in a spiritual-theological sense.
* "det naturlige Sind" – the fallen natural mind, Pauline anthropology.
* "Frigjørelse" – liberation with spiritual and theological force.
* "Lovvæsens Baand" – bondage to the law-principle, law as system.
* "Materialismens Baand" – not philosophical materialism only, but bondage to earthly-mindedness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses.
* Sermonic pacing with semicolon logic and accumulative argumentation.
* Rhetorical contrasts (life vs freedom; struggle vs stagnation).

Theological Hazards:

* Spiritual freedom vs life without freedom.
* Law and Gospel tension (Law’s bondage vs Spirit’s freedom).
* Mission as both outward conquest and inward purification.
* Sin understood as worldliness and pagan superstition.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Corporate address to the congregation’s conscience.
* Military and liberation imagery must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fører Herrens Krig i Verden" – echoes biblical warfare language (cf. Eph. 6).
* "Aandens Frihedskamp" – freedom of the Spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 3:17).
* "Tidens Tegn" – biblical phrase (Matt. 16:3).
* "mere Liv end Frihed" – paradoxical expression of vitality without true liberty.
* "Lysets Børn" – clear biblical idiom (John 12:36; Eph. 5:8).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation’s missionary calling is inseparable from its own spiritual liberation.
* Claim 1: Mission is part of the Spirit’s freedom-struggle against paganism and worldliness.
* Claim 2: Engaging seriously in mission aids the congregation’s inner freedom.
* Claim 3: The age is marked by vitality without freedom—spiritual bondage under law and world.
* Claim 4: Mission exposes hypocrisy and forces repentance within the church.
* Conclusion: Mission expands love, breaks material bondage, and unites believers across confessions.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Spiritual warfare – Ephesians 6.
* Freedom of the Spirit – 2 Corinthians 3.
* Children of light – John 12, Ephesians 5.
* Making disciples of all nations – Matthew 28.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against spiritual betrayal and hypocrisy must remain sharp.
The call to seriousness and repentance must not be diluted.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil" and "maa" imply necessity and inevitability.
* Moral imperatives must remain firm.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Frihed – freedom/liberty (spiritual)
* Hedenskab – paganism
* Verdslighed – worldliness
* Lov – Law (capitalized where theological)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Military conquest imagery preserved.
* Bondage and liberation metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in diagnosis.
* Hope in missionary obedience.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It is a great and weighty cause that follows from this position of the congregation as a link in that conquering host which wages the Lord’s war in the world. Missionary labor is an essential part of the spiritual struggle for freedom that is waged against the tyrannical dominance of paganism and worldliness over the natural mind. If the congregation enters this struggle for the Spirit’s freedom in earnest, it will therein also find a mighty help in the work of its own liberation. And this is of surpassing significance precisely in our time and in the position we have, taken as a whole, been given within it.

If we rightly discern the signs of the times, there is more life than freedom. It is possible to live, in a certain sense, almost without freedom. But it is a wretched condition for the spirit to be held in the bonds of a leagalism, half suffocated between the demands of the world and the compulsion of the Law. And yet there are not so few congregations that endure a miserable existence in precisely this manner. It is not possible here to enter into a more detailed explanation of this tangled and desperate condition. We can only say that there is an exceedingly great need for deliverance and, comparatively, little labor undertaken to relieve this need.

But here a vigorous missionary endeavor comes to the congregation’s strong aid. For if the congregation truly means in earnest the Christian conquest of the world by the Gospel, it will also of necessity come to the recognition that it is treason against Christ and the kingdom of God to nurture worldliness and pagan superstition in its own midst, while it fights to overcome these same enemies elsewhere. And nothing contributes more to the congregation’s liberation than that it loosens the bonds of materialism and at the same time gains greater room for love in heart and in deed.

These matters now mentioned are perhaps the most essential in this connection. Yet there is, besides, a multitude of things that are “added” for those who throw themselves with all their might into missionary labor.

It may be worth mentioning a few of them.

There is the fellowship between Christian persons and congregations without regard to the boundaries of confessions and church bodies, as they are set face to face with the immeasurable task of making all nations disciples of Jesus, and face to face with the nameless misery which paganism brings upon humanity. Mission continually brings us into fellowship with unnoticed Christian men and women of various confessions, with whom brotherly cooperation is often practiced under such conditions that it may be called unavoidable. For who, out in the dreadful darkness of paganism, would not rejoice in brotherly communion with the children of light?
