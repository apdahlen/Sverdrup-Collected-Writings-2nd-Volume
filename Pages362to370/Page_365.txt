STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Missionen" – carries strong 19th-century theological and eschatological weight; not merely institutional mission but participation in God’s redemptive advance.
* "Menigheden" – refers to the local congregation as a spiritual body, not simply an organization.
* "Guds Rige" – Kingdom of God; must retain biblical resonance, not reduced to ethical or social program.
* "Verdens-erobring" – metaphorical, spiritual conquest; must not be militarized politically.
* "Krig" / "Kamp" – spiritual warfare language rooted in Scripture.
* "Satans Vold" – Satan’s dominion or power; strong biblical-theological term.
* "Opofrelse" – sacrificial self-giving, not generic effort.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses and rhetorical pivots.
* Parenthetical clarifications and emphatic dashes.
* Sermonic pacing that should not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Relationship between mission, church, and Kingdom of God.
* Spiritual warfare imagery.
* Salvation language: death, liberation, Satan’s power.
* Protestant contrast with Catholic ecclesiology.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Moral seriousness and urgency.
* Risk of flattening rebuke and astonishment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tage Del i denne Krig" – idiom for active participation in spiritual struggle; cf. Eph. 6.
* "gjennemvævet af salig Fryd" – richly figurative; joy interwoven with suffering, cf. Rom. 5:3–5.
* "Verdens-erobring" – echoes Matt. 28:18–20; must retain missionary scope.
* "Krig mod Mørkets Magter" – cf. Eph. 6:12; KJV-style diction appropriate.
* "redde Sjæle fra Døden" – cf. James 5:20.
* "Satans Vold" – cf. Acts 26:18.
* Catholic standpoint description reflects Protestant polemic of the era.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: discrepancy between biblical vision of mission and present Christian reality.
* Indictment: many Christians and congregations do not truly participate.
* Clarification: mission is not token giving but central purpose with prayer and labor.
* Assertion: mission is spiritual warfare requiring sacrifice.
* Question: does the church benefit from participation?
* Contrast: Catholic answer versus implied Protestant understanding.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Spiritual warfare – Ephesians 6:12.
* Joy in victory and suffering – Romans 5; Philippians 1.
* Saving souls from death – James 5:20.
* Deliverance from Satan – Acts 26:18; Colossians 1:13.
* Kingdom expansion – Matthew 28:18–20.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain rebuke and astonishment (“with horror, I should hope”).
* Preserve seriousness of spiritual neglect.
* Avoid pastoral softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "lader sig ikke gjøre" – must be rendered as impossibility, not difficulty.
* "i høi Grad paakrævet" – strongly necessary.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Mission – Mission
* Menighed – Congregation
* Guds Rige – Kingdom of God
* Krig/Kamp – Warfare/struggle
* Satan’s power – Satan’s dominion

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Warfare imagery retained throughout.
* Kingdom expansion as conquest preserved metaphorically.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in diagnosis.
* Analytical calm in theological comparison.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically purposeful.
* Semicolons and dashes preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

If, after this glance at the biblical presentation of Mission and its connection with the Congregation and the Kingdom of God, we now look to the actual condition within Christendom, then we find— with horror, I should hope— that there are many Christians, at least in name, who do not appear to take any part in this warfare; they do not suffer its hardships, neither do they feel themselves thrilled with blessed joy at its victories. And worse still— comparatively few are the congregations which wholly and fully take part in the world-conquest of the Kingdom of God, and which make it a chief concern, a principal aim of their existence, to carry on missionary work at home and abroad.

It is therefore in the highest degree necessary to ask: What significance has Mission for the Congregation? Or does it perhaps make no difference whether the Congregation takes part in missionary labor or not?

And here it is not meant whether the Congregation contributes an offering or two to Mission during the year; rather, it is meant whether it is a chief matter for the Congregation to press the Kingdom of God further onward and the Gospel of God further out, so that it truly exerts itself in prayer and labor to that end. For I would note that it is a war against the powers of darkness of which we here speak; it is a struggle to save souls from death and to deliver them from the dominion of Satan. And this cannot be done without costing both exertion and sacrifice.

But does the Congregation, and the individual Christian, then gain anything by taking part therein?

To this question the answer would soon be given, if we could take the standpoint of Catholicism. For to it Mission is also a means of extending the power of the Church and increasing her glory; and naturally it is of great importance for every faithful son or daughter of the Church to be engaged in the work whereby the arm of the Church may reach unto the farthest regions of the earth.
