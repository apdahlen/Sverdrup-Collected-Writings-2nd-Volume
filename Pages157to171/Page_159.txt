STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* „Kirkeorden“: Not merely administrative order; carries ecclesiological and confessional weight (church polity, order of ministry and congregational life).
* „Den gamle Kirkeorden“: Polemical slogan; possibly undefined tradition invoked with normative force.
* „Formand“: Chair/president of an ecclesial body; authority-bearing role.
* „Aarsmøde“: Annual synod/assembly with doctrinal-political authority.
* „Organ“: Official mouthpiece/newspaper, not biological.
* „Fritirken“: Proper name for a free church movement; not generic.
* „Menighedsgrænser“: Congregational boundaries; ecclesial jurisdiction.
* „bentfrem“: Straightforward, plain-spoken, without evasion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with embedded qualifications and parenthetical clarifications.
* Rhetorical questions building cumulative pressure.
* Semicolon logic and parallel triads (Formandens Udtalelse / Aarsmødets Diskussion / „Lutheranerens“ Bemærkninger).
* Irony through repetition of quoted phrases.

Theological Hazards:

* Elevation of church order alongside Word and Sacraments.
* Binding authority versus adiaphora.
* Apostolic order vs. later tradition.
* Implicit accusation of legalism.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest yet sharp polemic; irony without mockery.
* Pressing the conscience of institutional authority.
* Avoiding modern journalistic tone; preserve 19th-century ecclesial gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* „Side om Side med Ordet og Sakramenterne“: Strong idiom indicating equality of authority.
* „gjøre baade sin egen Sag og os en Tjeneste“: Idiom meaning to serve one’s cause and the common good.
* „bentfrem Forklaring“: Plain, unambiguous explanation.
* „Stikord“: Catchword/slogan, not a mere keyword.
* „for gammel?“: Ironical understatement.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening challenge: Why no answer?
* Recounting prior inquiry and inadequate response.
* Clarification of fairness motive.
* Pressing demand for definition.
* Identification of alleged enemy (Free Church).
* Examination of specific accusations.
* Final climactic questions regarding authority and binding force.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Word and Sacraments as marks of the Church (Augsburg Confession VII).
* Apostolic order (Acts, Pastoral Epistles).
* Implicit law/gospel distinction.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp interrogatives.
* Preserve irony through repetition.
* Maintain public, ecclesial seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity implied in „er blevet saa betydningsfuld“ and „vil værne om“.
* Maintain binding/legal implications.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* „Kirkeorden“ → church order (consistent).
* „Ordet og Sakramenterne“ → Word and Sacraments.
* „lutherske Lære“ → Lutheran doctrine.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Spatial metaphors (side by side).
* Legal metaphors (binding law).

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm fairness vs. pointed critique.
* Irony vs. earnest inquiry.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long periodic sentences.
* Retain rhetorical pacing suitable for public reading.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsubsection{Why Not Answer?}

Two weeks ago we ventured to ask “The Lutheran” what is meant by “the old church order,” which has now in the United Church become so significant that it is placed side by side with the Word and the Sacraments and with the old Lutheran doctrine.

“The Lutheran” answers the question in a manner which, in truth, is not an answer at all. It says first that the author of the question in “Folkelbladet” “presumably knows as well as anyone among us what is meant by old Lutheran church order.” That is not the point.

We know what we have in mind when Chairman Høyme and the annual assembly of the United Church speak of “the old church order.” Whether it is Lutheran is another matter. But in this matter, as in every other, we wish to be as fair as possible; therefore we would prefer, before saying anything about “the old church order,” to hear what the official organ of the United Church means by this catchword. “The Lutheran” would render both its own cause and us a service by a plain and straightforward explanation of what is meant by “the old church order.” Why be so reticent in this matter? Chairman Høyme and the annual assembly regarded it as very important indeed. “The old church order” is, after all, one of the great blessings which the United Church already possesses alongside the Word and the Sacraments and alongside Lutheran doctrine. “The old church order” is something the United Church will guard, says the Chairman.

From the Chairman’s statement, from the discussion at the annual assembly, and from the remarks of “The Lutheran,” it is evident that it is the Free Church in particular which is regarded as an enemy of the old church order.

The Free Church recognizes, so far as we know, the apostolic order in the congregations; perhaps that is too old?

Of the two matters to which “The Lutheran” points, and which are said to be found particularly in the Free Church—namely, that one grants women the right to speak and vote in the congregation, and that one seeks to tear down all congregational boundaries—the latter is entirely unknown to us; the former is something that is found here and there both within and outside the United Church. Whether it is right to grant women the right to speak and vote in the congregation can be discussed at another time. What we would like to receive a plain and exhaustive answer to is this question: What is meant by “the old church order”? Is it really so precious a matter, and so binding a law, as God’s Word and as Lutheran doctrine? If it is, why is it so, or when did it become so?
