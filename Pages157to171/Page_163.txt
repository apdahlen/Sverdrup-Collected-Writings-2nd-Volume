STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kjøt og Blod" — biblical/pietistic phrase meaning fallen human nature; must not be reduced to mere physicality.
* "Klotter" — pejorative; connotes scribbler, petty writer, pretender; not simply "writer".
* "Standen," "Embedet," "Leveveien" — socially and theologically loaded vocational terms; must be kept distinct.
* "tidsdelig" — temporal/worldly as opposed to eternal; not merely "temporary".
* "Embedshøihed" — compound expressing office-exaltation; requires careful, consistent rendering.
* "Formynder" — guardian/tutor with authoritarian overtones.
* "Nøglerne" — biblical metaphor (keys of the kingdom).
* "Herlighed" — glory, splendor, not mere prestige.
* "Latinskolen" — historical institution; avoid modern school connotations.
* "Storfolk" — elite/gentry; not just "important people".
* "den høieste Helligdom" — cultic/biblical resonance; must remain elevated.
* "den gamle Kirkeorden" — technical ecclesial term; must remain stable.
* "trostfuld" — comforting, reassuring; not hopeful in modern emotional sense.
* "han Far" — colloquial reverential title for the pastor; must retain rustic tone.
* "frie Forholde" — political-ecclesial freedom; not merely personal liberty.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with subordinate clauses must not be fragmented.
* Rhetorical questions must remain interrogative and forceful.
* Parallel priest–people contrasts must retain symmetry.
* Explanatory clauses introduced by "thi" (for) must preserve causal logic.

Theological Hazards:

* Calling vs. self-chosen office.
* Authority over souls.
* The keys of heaven (binding/loosing).
* Worldly honor vs. divine service.
* Office upheld by divine calling vs. secular power.

Voice Hazards:

* Satirical sharpness must not be softened.
* Moral accusation must remain implicit but forceful.
* Distance between narrator and subject must remain critical.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kjøt og Blod" — echoes Matthew 16:17; denotes fallen human inclination.
* "have Nøglerne" — Matthew 16:19; authority to bind and loose.
* "staa med Hatten i Haanden" — idiom of deference and subservience.
* "Adgang til den høieste Helligdom" — Hebrews 9 imagery; priestly mediation.
* "den røde Traad" — idiom meaning unifying theme.
* "han Far" — Norwegian rural pietistic honorific for the pastor.
* "holde sig oppe" — sustain authority/status.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: The clerical office attracts fallen human nature.
* Explanation: Many desire the office for honor and ease.
* Expansion: Even sincerely called ministers are tempted.
* Core claim: The old church order is built on office-exaltation.
* Illustration: Educational and social structures reinforce this.
* Contrast: Norway vs. America.
* Conclusion: New strategies are used to preserve old clerical supremacy.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 16:17 — flesh and blood.
* Matthew 16:19 — keys of the kingdom.
* Hebrews 9–10 — access to the holy of holies.
* General pastoral epistle tone (authority, calling).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain irony without humor.
* Preserve moral exposure through description, not invective.
* Keep accusatory force indirect but unmistakable.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "bør" implications preserved as necessity.
* Avoid replacing obligation with suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Embedshøihed" → "exaltation of office" (consistent).
* "Menighed" → "congregation".
* "Aand" → "Spirit" (capitalized for divine reference).
* "Herlighed" → "glory".

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Keep spatial metaphors (above/below, distance).
* Preserve cultic imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Irony vs. lament.
* Observation vs. indictment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long-period sentences.
* Maintain sermonic rhythm and accumulation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

It has its appeal to flesh and blood. Many a scribbler has thought to himself: if only one were a pastor!

Can anyone be surprised if there are those who like this for their own sake and would gladly have it so, if it has fallen to their lot to become pastors, even if it were in America?

It is a quite natural thing that all those who have become pastors without being driven by the Spirit of God would gladly have it so. All those who have chosen the estate, the office, the whole way of life, would gladly have it so. Even some of those who truly from the beginning sought the blessed work and the holy service for God and his congregation succumb to the temptation of temporal greatness, honor, and enjoyment, when opportunity presents itself.

But add now to this what for many pastors of “the old church order” is the main thing: that they are the people’s religious guardians, those who have “the keys,” so that they open and shut the kingdom of heaven for human beings; it is no wonder if those who have first been seized by the thought of the exalted office will not give it up. For to have a religious power over human souls—that is in itself, apart from any outward advantages that may follow with it, nevertheless the greatest glory.

A red thread runs through the whole conception of the exalted office. The Latin school and the university and the examinations are the steps of the stairway that lift one up into this higher sphere, where only office-holders or the prominent people move about. The common man ought, if not exactly bodily then at least spiritually, to stand with his hat in his hand before this being. The pastor is the learned one, before whom the ignorant man bows. The pastor is the holy one, before whom the worldly man bows. The pastor is the one who has access to the highest sanctuary; the people must devoutly behold him from afar.

Such is “the old church order.” This is the United Church’s binding banner and “pure flag,” if we may dare to believe the chairman. There is something indeed comforting in many places in Norway connected with this order. For the pastors need only the royal appointment and the worldly salary in order to maintain their elevated position. And besides, there were many who quite simply looked up to “Father,” without reasoning much about whether “Father” truly was such an exalted being or not.

This comforting character falls away from “the old church order” in America. Under our free conditions there is no royal power that holds the office high above the people. Other supports must be found. Might not the extraordinary zeal for a great association have its root in this need for new supports for the old exalted office?

Would it not fit well with this purpose to revile those who ask after the congregation?

But there are also many other means that are used in order to attain the great goal. We need not mention them. Most of those who have followed the ecclesiastical development among us know a thing or two about this sad history.
