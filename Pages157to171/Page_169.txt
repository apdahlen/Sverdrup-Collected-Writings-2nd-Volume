STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards

* Vanen / tilvante Skikke og Ceremonier: habitually practiced customs and ceremonies; risk of trivializing their binding, quasi-compulsory force.
* Trældomsfrygt: literally “fear of bondage/slavery”; conveys spiritual servility and conscience-bound fear, not mere anxiety.
* Overtro: superstition with ecclesial-pietistic nuance, not folk superstition alone.
* Menighed: congregation as a spiritual body, not merely an administrative parish.
* Statskirken: the state church as an inherited ecclesial system; requires careful rendering without anachronism.
* Udvortes Skik: outward custom/practice; danger of rendering too weakly as “external form.”
* Aandelig Indflydelse: spiritual influence or efficacy; not social influence.
* Kirkeorden: church order; carries normative, quasi-sacral authority.
* Menighedens Stiftelse / Tilblivelse: founding/coming into being of a congregation; theological, not institutional only.

Syntactic Hazards

* Long conditional constructions (“Dersom derfor … saa er det …”) must retain cumulative logic.
* Heavy use of causal connectors (“thi,” “saa,” “derfor”)—must not be flattened.
* Sermonic pacing with semicolon-like turns and reflective asides.

Theological Hazards

* Distinction between true congregation formed by Word and Spirit versus outward ecclesial cohesion.
* Critique of fear-based adherence versus life in Christ.
* Spiritual vitality vs institutional preservation.

Voice Hazards

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran-pietistic tone.
* Addressing collective conscience (“vi”).
* Danger of modern sociological tone replacing moral-theological gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “det Baand, som … holder Menighederne sammen” – binding cord/bond; metaphor of constraint, not unity of love.
* “Ordets og Aandens samlende Magt” – Word and Spirit as divine agents (cf. Romans 10, John 6).
* “liden Kristendom” – little Christianity, meaning little living faith, not lack of doctrine.
* “gaa tilbunds i denne Sag” – go to the bottom of the matter; investigate the root.
* “Hjerte og Hjem, i Hus og Kirke” – totality of life; echoes Deut. 6.
* “mørke Sider” – dark aspects; moral-spiritual defects, not merely inconveniences.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Where congregations are held together by habit, fear, and superstition, reformers will be persecuted.
* Diagnosis: This condition is an inherited defect of the state church.
* Consequence: Weak Christianity and minimal spiritual influence.
* Case Study: Anxiety over losing youth to the church.
* Root Cause: Youth are less bound by superstition and inherited customs.
* Counterfactual: True congregations animated by Christ’s Spirit would retain youth naturally.
* Call to Examination: Necessity of honestly confronting defects.
* Aim: To awaken longing for a truer founding of congregations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Word and Spirit as constitutive of the church (John 4:24; Acts 2).
* Bondage vs freedom (Galatians 5).
* Life in heart and home (Deuteronomy 6; Colossians 3).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain seriousness of ecclesial judgment.
* Preserve implicit rebuke toward fear-based religion.
* Avoid sociological neutrality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skulde” (should) retains moral necessity.
* “vil finde” (will find) retains certainty, not possibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Aand = Spirit
* Kristendom = Christianity as lived faith

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Bond, inheritance, dark sides, foundation—retain imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From diagnosis → lament → hope through truthful examination.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Rhythmic parallelism retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

If, therefore, habit and long-established customs and ceremonies, in connection with a measure of servile fear and superstition, are the bond that in many places holds the congregations together, then it is not at all to be wondered at that the few men and women among us who labor for change are subjected to bitter persecution.

This sorrowful inheritance from the state church—that the congregation is more an outward custom than a result of the gathering power of the Word and the Spirit—is self‑evidently one of the chief reasons why there is so little Christianity within the congregations, and why the congregations exercise so little spiritual influence.

Here also lies the reason why so many ask with such anxiety: What shall we do to preserve the youth for the Lutheran Church? \textbf{If we go to the bottom of this matter, we shall find that the reason for the youth’s alarming inclination to depart from the Lutheran Church lies precisely in this, that the young people are not so bound by the habits of the state church and have no superstitious fear of breaking “the old church order.”}

If we had congregation—true congregation—with the Spirit and life of Christ in heart and home, in house and church, then there would not be such great difficulties in this matter.

But if, in this way, the formation of many congregations is of doubtful value in a spiritual sense, then it is not to be wondered at that we find many dark sides in congregational life under the old church order. And it will not be out of place to look a little more closely at the deficiencies under which we suffer; for only when we see the deficiencies is there any hope of having them remedied. It will do good to look at the difference between what the congregations ought to be and what they in reality are; perhaps someone might begin to long for a truer foundation for the congregation than that to which we have commonly accustomed ourselves.
