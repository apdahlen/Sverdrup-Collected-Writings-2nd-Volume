STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kirkeorden" – denotes an entire ecclesial system/order, not merely administrative rules.
* "Verdsliggjørelse" – secularization in the sense of spiritual corruption through worldliness.
* "Menigheden" – congregation as living body, not abstract institution.
* "Embedsmand" – office-holder with royal/state authority, not generic official.
* "Fordærvelse" – corruption/decay with moral-spiritual force.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal logic.
* Rhetorical contrasts (Kirke vs. Verden; Menighed vs. Embede).
* Sermonic pacing with escalating critique.

Theological Hazards:

* Church–world distinction.
* Cross-bearing vs. worldly honor.
* Nature of ministry and vocation.
* Ecclesiology (congregation-centered church).

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet pastoral tone.
* Earnest admonition.
* Avoidance of irony or satire flattening.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gaa i brange Spor" – to walk dangerous paths; moral-spiritual peril.
* "løftet Nakke" – image of pride and social elevation.
* "de høiere Lag" – social elite, not spiritual maturity.
* "Trappetrin" – metaphor for hierarchical ascent.

Biblical/Pietistic Resonance:

* Cross vs. worldly glory (cf. Luke 9:23).
* Church as congregation (Acts 2; 1 Corinthians 12).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The old Church Order is a product of long-standing misuse and secularization.
* Claim: Its influence distorts all areas of church life.
* Warning: The Norwegian Lutheran Church in America risks repeating these errors.
* Analysis: Priesthood shaped as royal office leads to distorted education.
* Evidence: Latin schools, universities, ambition, exhaustion, alienation from congregation.
* Concession: Acknowledgment of capable pastors despite flawed system.
* Conclusion: Such education is unsuitable for a free church in a free land.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Cross-bearing vs. worldly ease (Luke 14:27).
* Separation from the people (Ezekiel 34 implicit).
* Servant ministry vs. lordship (Matthew 20:25–28).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp critique without mockery.
* Retain moral urgency and ecclesial concern.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and inevitability in critiques.
* Maintain rhetorical questions with full force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke – Church
* Menighed – congregation
* Embede – office
* Verdsliggjørelse – secularization/worldliness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Uphill path, stair-steps, exhaustion, distance from people.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning → analysis → concession → renewed critique.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhetorical flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsubsection{The Old Church Order and the Education of Pastors}

It is centuries of misuse gathered together in what is called “the old Church Order.”

Its influence therefore shows itself also in all areas of church life. And now, since this old Church Order has become a central concern for the great majority, it is necessary to illuminate it from various sides, if this might serve as an admonition. For it would be grievous if our Norwegian Lutheran Church in America were to walk blindly in dangerous paths, when yet the Lord in his Word has shown it a far better way, namely the congregation.

The old Church Order is the result of a long-standing secularization of the Church, or of an attempt to unite the Church and the world. Congregation and pastor were to be Christians without trial and without the cross. This is the inner corruption that gnaws at the marrow both in the papal church and in the state church.

We cannot cover the entire ground in a small newspaper article. But we may at least attempt to take hold of one side at a time.

According to the old Church Order, the pastor is a royal officeholder; and his upbringing is arranged accordingly. Now one cannot retain a royal officeholder in America; yet, in spite of these circumstances, one insists that pastoral education must be the same as in the state church.

One wishes to hold fast to Latin schools and universities according to the state-church pattern. If one cannot raise young men up into the royal office, one can at least, by means of Latin, raise them into “the higher strata.”

It is a lofty goal; for it is no small thing to be the representative of King and Church, who goes with head held high through crowds of men who, bowing, bare their heads before the venerable one.

Therefore the path upward is steep and abrupt. The many classes, the dead languages, the harsh examinations, and the solemn ordination are steps of a stairway, each of which is burdensome in itself, and all together almost insurmountable.

And because it is so hard to advance, all schools are arranged so as to awaken petty vanity and unscrupulous ambition and rivalry, in the hope that one might nevertheless attain good results, as each strains to come more quickly forward and higher up than the other.

In the process many become overstrained; most are quite satisfied with their labor once they have arrived at “the office.”

And in reality it is doubtful whether they are fit for much work at all when they finally, half worn out, arrive at the place where the work ought to be done. For all the while, as they believed they were clearing their way to the “higher ranks,” they were steadily removing themselves farther and farther from the people and from the congregation, and became strangers to both. They did not truly prepare themselves for work; they prepared themselves to pass examinations and obtain office.

By this we do not deny that the state church has capable pastors. We merely draw attention to how misguided their education has been, and how much they have had to relearn when they were to take hold of real work.

Neither do we deny that many men may become poor workers despite having received an education planned on a healthier foundation.

Nevertheless, it is in advance probable that the state-church pastoral education fits neither a free land nor a free church. When we are not to have royal officeholders, why then should we have their education?
