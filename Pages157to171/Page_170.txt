STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Menigheden” carries the New Testament sense of the gathered congregation, not merely an institution.
* “Læren” refers to doctrine in a confessional, dogmatic sense.
* “Uefterretteligheder” implies unreliability, misrepresentation, lack of factual or moral accuracy.
* “Fædrenes Anordning” points to patristic or ecclesiastical regulations, not merely traditions.
* “Kirkeorden” is a technical ecclesial term (church order/polity), not general orderliness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long conditional sentences with layered logic must be preserved.
* Polemical rhythm and cumulative reasoning rely on semicolons and extended clauses.
* Rhetorical questions are central and must remain pointed.

Theological Hazards:

* Binding authority of Scripture versus church tradition is a core Lutheran principle.
* Equating congregational teaching with doctrinal teaching has ecclesiological implications.
* References to synods, state churches, and hierarchy are not neutral but doctrinally charged.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical seriousness and confessional sharpness must not be softened.
* The author’s confrontational, earnest tone must remain intact.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “gaa bort fra Sagens Kjerne” – to evade the real issue.
* “lægge et Ord med i Laget” – insert oneself into a debate.
* “drikker gammel Vin” – clinging uncritically to old arrangements (cf. Matt. 9:17 echo).
* “Streiflys” – side-glances or insinuations rather than direct argument.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The real issue has not been addressed by Dr. Schmidt.
* Core Question: Is the NT binding for the congregation as it is for doctrine?
* Conditional Argument: If tradition governs, Lutheranism collapses.
* Polemical Conclusion: Without shared authority, discussion is impossible.
* Evidence: A concrete quotation demonstrating misrepresentation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Implicit appeal to sola Scriptura.
* “Old wine” metaphor echoes New Testament imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain accusatory clarity.
* Preserve the exclusionary force of “impossible discussion.”

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “er” / “er ikke” retained as absolute claims.
* Conditional constructions preserved with full force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden = congregation
* Læren = doctrine
* Kirkeorden = church order

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve “old wine” imagery.
* Preserve juridical metaphors (law, rule, measure).

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity throughout; no consolation introduced here.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Rhetorical questions preserved verbatim.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsubsection{The Core of the Matter}

Dr. Schmidt even appears now and then in “The Lutheran” and attempts to insert himself into the discussion of the congregation. That can only occur insofar as he departs from the core of the matter and serves up a multitude of inaccuracies.

The core of the matter is this, which Dr. Schmidt has not yet touched:
Is the New Testament’s teaching concerning the congregation just as binding upon Christians as what it teaches concerning doctrine?

For if it is not the New Testament, but rather the ordinances of the Church Fathers, that constitute law and rule for the Christian congregations, then the Lutheran Church is thereby condemned; for it has established the principle that Scripture alone is rule and guide, and the ordinances of the Fathers are not rule and guide.

And if Dr. Schmidt, together with Chairman Høyme, drinks old wine and believes in the old church order with indifference toward and disregard for, the New Testament’s presentation of the congregation, then all discussion with him is impossible; for then there is absolutely no guarantee as to what he may devise. Without a shared point of departure and common measure, every discussion is useless and harmful.

Come, therefore, to the core of the matter, which is the question whether the New Testament is, in the same sense, a binding rule for the congregation as for doctrine. Is this so, or is it not so?

At the same time we shall show what we mean by Dr. Schmidt’s misrepresentations by a single example drawn from an innumerable multitude, which would only unnecessarily weary the readers.

He says, for example, in “The Lutheran” of December 15, 1897:

“Chairman Høyme had during the annual meeting let fall a remark to the effect that our fellowship intends to hold fast to ‘the old church order.’ It was not difficult to understand that by this reference was meant all this new and foreign matter which the friends of the Free Church now insistently come forward with,” etc.

And a little further down he continues:

“But our opponent seizes upon this expression concerning ‘the old church order’ and seeks, by a multiplicity of direct accusations and indirect side-lights, to bring it about that our fellowship, under the name of ‘old church order,’ maintains and defends approximately all the wrong that has existed in the world before the establishment of any sort of church order whatsoever—whether in the synod or in Lutheran state churches or in the hierarchy of the Middle Ages or even in the Jewish church, both under Caiaphas in Christ’s time and under all the false prophets in the older times.”
