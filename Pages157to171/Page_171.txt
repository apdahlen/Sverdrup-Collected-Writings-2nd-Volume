STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* uefterretteligt: implies reckless disregard for truth, not merely incorrect.
* uhederligt: moral dishonesty, not simple rudeness.
* lod falde: idiomatic; suggests casual, accidental utterance.
* heisede og løftede den høit: metaphor of raising a flag; public, intentional display.
* det rene Flag: symbolic phrase; purity, clarity of allegiance.
* tilstemme: formal ecclesial approval; not casual agreement.
* Bekjendelsen: confessional Lutheran sense; must not be generalized.
* Kirkeorden: ecclesial polity/order; doctrinally loaded.
* Frikirke: specific 19th-century Lutheran free-church controversy.
* storslagne Stikord: rhetorical slogan with ironic edge.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long polemical sentences with layered negations.
* Repeated contrast between “lod falde” and intentional action.
* Rhetorical questions that drive argument.
* Parenthetical asides that sharpen accusation.

Theological Hazards:

* Kirkeorden linked with confession and divine grace.
* Implicit authority of church assemblies.
* Tension between state church, free church, and Roman Catholic church.

Voice Hazards:

* Sharp polemical tone; accusations of dishonesty.
* Irony and moral pressure must not be softened.
* Public accountability rhetoric.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “lod falde”: idiom meaning to let slip casually; here denied.
* “heisede og løftede den høit”: public, deliberate elevation; biblical/banner imagery.
* “det rene Flag”: metaphor for doctrinal clarity and integrity.
* “grebet dette Udtryk”: journalistic phrase—seizing and misusing a term.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening refutation of alleged falsehood.
* Demonstration from official records.
* Expansion of responsibility from individual to assembly.
* Citation of two binding decisions.

* Historical-theological analysis of what “old church order” must mean.
* Rhetorical challenge demanding clarification.
* Concluding appeal to public accountability.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Flag/banner imagery echoes biblical symbols of allegiance (e.g., banners of the Lord).
* “By God’s grace” reflects confessional Lutheran formulae.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Accusations of dishonesty retained.
* Irony and moral pressure maintained.
* No conciliatory smoothing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Earnest appeal at close.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where argument accumulates.
* Rhetorical questions preserved intact.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

This is unreliable and dishonest talk. “The old church order” was not a remark that Chairman Høyme “let fall” during the annual meeting. And Dr. Schmidt knows that this is not true. “The old church order” is part of Chairman Høyme’s official and written report to the annual meeting of the United Church. And he did not let this phrase “fall”; oh no—he hoisted and lifted it high and called it “the pure flag.” If the flag has now fallen, then it is certainly not Høyme’s fault; it is Dr. Schmidt who “lets it fall.”

Nor is it only Høyme who is responsible for “the old church order.” The annual meeting has adopted two resolutions, both of which concern this matter and which confirm Høyme’s words. The annual meeting decided “to endorse the chairman’s statements regarding the so‑called free church of Augsburg’s Friends,” which obviously, as anyone can see, includes also the statement concerning “the old church order.”

The annual meeting also decided: “By God’s grace the United Church will hold fast to the Confession and the church order that accords with it.”

The latter phrase was, as those who were present will remember, another wording for “the old church order.”

Oh no, Høyme was not alone in speaking of “the old church order,” and it did not “fall” at all during the annual meeting; it was supported both strongly and effectively, so that it remained standing. If anyone has let it fall, that has happened after the annual meeting.

Nor is it true that Folkelbladet has “seized upon this expression” and read into it what was not intended.

We have a solid record in this matter, and Dr. Schmidt knows that he is using dishonest language when he says the opposite.

We began by asking “Lutheraneren,” an organ that is certainly not unknown to Dr. Schmidt, whether it would tell us what was meant by the old church order. To this “Lutheraneren” replied that Folkelbladet knew that just as well itself. We asked again and waited a long time for another and better answer; but we received none. We were therefore left to conclude that our answer was good enough for “Lutheraneren,” and so we gave the answer ourselves. And then we stated that the old church order could not derive from the United Church; for then it would not be old. It must rather be sought in the Lutheran state churches; for back to the Catholic Church we would not go, even though there might be good reason to do so.

Can Dr. Schmidt now say what wrong we have done in this? Or is not “the old church order” precisely the old state‑church order, adapted to new conditions under which the poor old order has received some peculiar additions of highly doubtful value?

But if it is not this, then what is it?

If, namely, the men of the United Church are willing to explain the meaning of their grandiose slogan, then we shall be grateful, because at least we will have achieved that much. The people may then this year learn what their “pure flag” is, which the leaders raised last year.
