STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards

* "Stade" — not merely "damage" but injury, harm, detriment with moral and spiritual weight.
* "Menighed" — congregation as a spiritual body, not merely an assembly.
* "Kirkeorden" — church order / ecclesiastical order, with juridical and historical force.
* "udvortes" — outward, external, merely formal.
* "Bodfærdighed" — repentance as lived contrition, not abstract remorse.
* "Væsen" — character, manner of being, spirit.
* "raadne Fred" — rotten peace, moral-spiritual decay, not simple calm.

Syntactic Hazards

* Long argumentative sentences with causal buildup.
* Rhetorical questions that must retain pressure.
* Parallel accusations accumulating force.
* Sermonic cadence resisting simplification.

Theological Hazards

* Repentance, faith, spiritual life vs. death.
* Church gathered by Word vs. coercion.
* Worldliness as spiritual enmity.
* Habitual Christianity vs. living faith.

Voice Hazards

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran tone.
* Sharp contrasts and moral indictment.
* Address to collective conscience.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "nødvendigt Onde" — necessary evil, deeply ironic and accusatory.
* "Verdens Væsen" — the spirit/way of the world (cf. Romans 12).
* "Vanekristendom" — habitual, cultural Christianity devoid of life.
* "søde Ro" — false spiritual comfort.
* Biblical resonance with repentance, living faith, spiritual sleep.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening question challenging assumptions.
* Assertion: congregation has suffered deeply.
* Evidence: distorted priest–congregation relationship.
* Deeper diagnosis: state church coercion.
* Historical grounding: Constantine onward.
* Theological conclusion: habit cannot produce faith.
* Climactic warning: sleeping church as enemy of spiritual life.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Gathering by the Word — Romans 10.
* Repentance and living faith — Acts 2, James 2.
* Worldliness as enmity — James 4:4.
* Spiritual sleep — Ephesians 5:14.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain accusation, urgency, and severity.
* No mitigation of warnings.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and impossibility statements.
* Avoid weakening inevitability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed — congregation
* Bodfærdighed — repentance
* Tro — faith
* aandeligt Liv — spiritual life

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleeping church, rotten peace, habit as enemy.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Diagnostic severity → climactic warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long clauses and rhetorical flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

\subsection{Has the Congregation Been Harmed?}

We have previously pointed out that “the old Church Order” has done great harm to the clergy, to their relationship with the congregation, and to their education.

Has, then, the congregation suffered no harm from this old Church Order? Or is the congregation such a solid and invulnerable organism that nothing can damage it?

It is already more than enough harm for congregations that they have been brought into a distorted relationship with their own pastors. It is a fruit of the old Church Order that many congregations regard the pastor as a necessary evil, which, for superstitious reasons, they nevertheless do not dare to abolish. It is also a fruit of the old Church Order that in many places the few earnest men and women within the congregations look upon the pastor with mistrust, as a man who must almost certainly be counted among the opponents of spiritual life. It is likewise an effect of the old Church Order that very often there is a chasm between pastor and congregation that is insurmountable, because the pastors have received a schooling that is neither rooted in the people nor congregational in character.

But this sorrowful estrangement, under which both pastors and congregations suffer almost equally, whether they now feel it or not, is by no means all. One cannot even ask: at what point has the congregation suffered harm? One must rather ask: at what point has it not suffered harm?

For the fact of the matter is that under the old Church Order the congregation has become thoroughly hostile to spiritual life; so completely has it taken the nature of the world into itself.

In the state church the congregation is not gathered by the Word, by the invitation of the Gospel, but by outward coercion and worldly remuneration. And this has been practiced for centuries, ever since the time of Constantine the Great, until coercion has become a habit, which is now baptized with the fair name: Old Church Order.

But no old habit has ever been able to change human hearts. And however much it has become a habit to belong to the congregation in a merely outward way, neither true repentance nor living faith has become any habit, and can never become one.

And therefore we find that the old habit reigns among our people to a great extent; but true Christianity and spiritual life are rarely to be found; and in most places where they are found, they are exposed to the fiercest hostility of Christianity reduced to habit.

The sleeping and worldly church is the bitterest enemy of spiritual life. For the manifest world is not so afraid of losing its worldly pleasures as the sleeping church is afraid of being disturbed in its sweet repose and its rotten peace.
