STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The New Testament lays out the path of the Christian congregation in all essential respects, and the education of pastors constitutes no exception to this rule.

Christ himself trained twelve men whom he intended to send out to preach the Gospel. He was not satisfied with those who “sat on Moses’ seat”; he desired other and better workers in his harvest.

This education is exemplary. It is true that it does not show us how the disciples acquired the human knowledge which we find them to possess. But the spirit and character are presented in such a way that it leaves no doubt that this is an example to be followed.

Time and again we find that ambition—which is now so diligently fostered in all higher and lower schools, and which has become the dreadful Moloch that devours our children—also gained a foothold among the Lord’s first and closest disciples.

Driven by ambition, the disciples contended with one another over who was to be the greatest among them. They did not know that they were walking in the company of the Holy One who would soon be crucified before their eyes.

Seized by ambition, the sons of Zebedee asked to be allowed to rise into the higher ranks and sit at Jesus’ right and left hand when he came into his kingdom.

Was it then Jesus’ will that the disciples, by ambitious rivalry, should strain their powers to the utmost in order to surpass one another in knowledge and obtain better examination results than one another?

He answered by taking a little child and setting it in the midst of the ambitious and contending disciples, and admonished them to humble themselves as this child.

He answered instead by saying that the question is not about lifting oneself up to the highest place, but about descending to the lowest; it is not about desiring and obtaining, but about loving and giving.

And he holds an examination of a different kind than the universities do, when he asks Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? And he gives testimony and credentials in his own way, when he says: 

Tend my sheep!
