STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Aand / aandssdrevne" – carries pneumatological force (Spirit-driven), not mere enthusiasm.
* "Kundskabsrige" – learned, knowledgeable, with academic overtones.
* "Korsdragere" – cross-bearers; discipleship imagery (Luke 9).
* "Menigheden" – congregation/church body, not abstract church.
* "Præsteuddannelsen" – ministerial formation, not generic education.
* "døde Sprog" – classical/biblical languages, polemically framed.
* "Tarv" – need, requirement, pastoral necessity.
* "Hinder" – stumbling block, serious obstruction.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with doctrinal contrast.
* Repeated parallel imperatives.
* Polemical rhetorical questions at the end.

Theological Hazards:

* Word–Spirit relation (Word as Spirit and Life).
* Damage of knowledge without Spirit.
* Discipleship defined as humility and soul-saving.
* Church order vs. free church identity.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, admonitory Lutheran tone.
* Sharp critique of academicism.
* Warning against misdirected ministerial training.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Ordet, som er Aand og Liv" – John 6:63 echo.
* "Alfa og Omega" – Revelation 1:8.
* "Korsdragere" – synoptic discipleship idiom.
* "Træng ind" – press into; intense, almost violent striving.
* "arbeide blandt Menneskene" – pastoral labor, not social work.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Jesus trains disciples for Spirit-driven humility, not ambition.
* Claim: True knowledge and Spirit come only through the Word.
* Polemic: Academic languages have value only as servants of the Word.
* Exhortation: Press into Scripture as the core of ministerial formation.
* Objection raised and partially conceded.
* Warning: Schools can obstruct if they lead away from the goal.
* Conclusion: Church conflict arises from confusion here; open question posed.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 6:63 – Word as Spirit and Life.
* Luke 9:23 – Bearing the cross.
* Revelation 1:8 – Alpha and Omega.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp contrasts.
* Retain rebuke of ambition and academic pride.
* Preserve urgency in imperatives.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in "kan kun gives" / "maa" logic.
* Do not weaken prohibitions or warnings.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand = Spirit
* Ordet = the Word
* Kundskab = knowledge
* Menighed = congregation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Cross-bearing imagery retained.
* Alpha and Omega retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity → exhortation → polemic → questioning close.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and parallel imperatives.
* Allow sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It would lead too far to go into details. We recognize the main point, which is this: that Jesus trains his disciples for something infinitely higher than being learned men, and for quite the opposite of ambitious heads. He does not merely want them knowledgeable; he wants them driven by the Spirit. He wants to make them humble bearers of the cross, eager to save souls.

Both the knowledge that is needed and the Spirit—without which knowledge becomes harmful rather than beneficial in the congregation—can be given only in and through the Word. Beside the Word, which is Spirit and life, all dead languages are without value in pastoral education. Only when the study of the dead languages stands in the service of the living Word of God does it gain value in this connection.

Immerse yourself in the Word! 

Immerse yourself in the Scriptures! 

This is the Alpha and Omega of Christian, congregational, and free-church pastoral education. Learn to know God’s revelation and God’s Spirit! Learn to love Jesus; learn to love souls! Learn to labor among people!

One will reply: yes, but no school can do this anyway. Each person must learn this for himself in the experience of life. So be it; and yet a school that leads away from the goal can become a great hindrance.

We believe that the most important source of all church conflict among us is precisely the lack of clarity at this chief point. Many feel that the state-church clergy do not correspond to the needs of free congregations. They look around to see how something better might be put in their stead. But because the poor Augsburg has dared to attempt a small change, it is therefore persecuted and threatened with destruction. Is it entirely certain that the old church order, in this respect, is exactly what fits a free church, and that it will therefore bring peace?
