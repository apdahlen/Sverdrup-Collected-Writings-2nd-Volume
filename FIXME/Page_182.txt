STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" — carries ecclesiological weight (congregation as spiritual body, not mere assembly).
* "Hovmod" — more than pride; sinful arrogance before God.
* "Dommesyge" — censorious judgmentalism; moral-theological nuance.
* "Frikirken" — specific free-church movement; not generic non-state church.
* "ufristeligt" — archaic nuance suggesting strong, almost irresistible temptation.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, multi-clause sentences with quoted slogans and parenthetical clarifications.
* Rhetorical framing through reported speech and polemical rebuttal.
* Use of dashes and quotation marks to stage controversy.

Theological Hazards:

* Definition of true "Menighed" as spiritual reality, not institutional presence.
* Accusations of pride and judgment as sins affecting ecclesial discourse.
* Implicit doctrine of the church (where the church truly exists and where it does not).

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical, earnest, late-19th-century Lutheran editorial tone.
* Risk of smoothing that would blunt rebuke and argumentative sharpness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Vil I ha’ Menighed?" — rhetorical challenge, not informational question; presses conscience.
* "et bevæget Ord" — a phrase that stirred controversy; literally “a moved word,” idiomatically “a charged phrase.”
* "Slagord" — slogan with polemical force.
* "kunde jo ikke hjælpe" — understated irony; stresses insufficiency.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Citation of opponent (J. R. S.) accusing Free Church of pride and judgment.
* Clarification of opponent’s reasoning: the question would only be valid if no church existed before.
* Rebuttal by logical extension: existence of congregations in a few places does not address absence elsewhere.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ecclesiology echoes Pauline concern for the whole body, not isolated members (implicit).
* Moral language of pride and judgment reflects biblical vice lists (e.g., Romans 1; James 4).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain polemical firmness without sarcasm.
* Retain moral seriousness in accusations and rebuttal.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and logical force in phrases like "kun da" (only then).
* Maintain firmness of negation in "kan selvfølgelig ikke mene".

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Menighed" consistently rendered as "congregation" or "church" depending on context, with preference for "congregation" when concrete.
* "Hovmod" as "pride" with moral weight.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve spatial contrast between places where congregation exists and where it does not.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between accusation and sober rebuttal must remain clear.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhythmic clauses suitable for public reading.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

2. “Do You Want a Congregation?”

[Source: Editorial articles in *Folkebladet* for September 29, 1897; March 16, 23, and 30, 1898. — Ed.]

“Lutheraneren” of September 8, 1897. The quotation is found in an article entitled “Compulsion or Vitality,” which forms a reply to an editorial article in *Folkebladet* of September 1, 1897 bearing the same title. The question, “Do you want a congregation?” was raised during the discussion of the topic “Congregation and Congregational Life” at the annual meeting of the Augsburg Synod in Fargo, N. Dak., in 1896, and in a certain way became “a charged phrase.” — Ed.

Is It Pride?

In “Lutheraneren,” J. R. S. writes: “Yes, I understand that it is a lawfully great portion of tempting pride and censorious judgment when the ‘Free Church’ now makes it its watchword: ‘Do you want a congregation?’—as though there had been no congregation among us before, but one first had to be brought to us by the emissaries of the ‘Free Church.’”*)

J. R. S. maintains that it is pride and censorious judgment to ask: Do you want a congregation? because such a question would only then be reasonable if there had previously been no congregation among us.

By this, J. R. S. can of course not mean that in one out of a hundred—or in ten out of a hundred—places there exists a congregation. For what existed in some places could not, after all, help the other places where it did not exist.
