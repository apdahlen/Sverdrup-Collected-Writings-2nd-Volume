STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" — carries New Testament ecclesial sense (congregation/body), not mere parish or institution.
* "Verdensforsagelse" — world-renunciation in pietistic/Lutheran sense, not social withdrawal.
* "Nidkjærhed" — zeal with moral heat; stronger than modern "enthusiasm."
* "Sag" — cause/work of Christ; not a generic issue.
* "Menighedslemmer" — members as living participants, not registrants.
* "menighedsmæssigt" — according to the nature of a congregation, ecclesially proper.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long exhortational sentences with cumulative clauses.
* Rhetorical questions driving conscience rather than seeking information.
* Parallel imperatives listing spiritual actions.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the church as active body of believers.
* Mission as shared vocation, not clerical task.
* Divine agency vs. human inability in becoming Christian/congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation; warnings against passivity.
* Communal address (“we,” “all”).
* Sermonic cadence must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "vaagner op" — awaken spiritually (cf. Eph. 5:14).
* "brændende Nidkjærhed for Sjælenes Frelse" — echoes missionary and revivalist rhetoric.
* "fra Barnet til graahaardet Olding" — merism indicating all ages.
* "Alle, alle" — emphatic repetition for total participation.
* "Kristi Sag" — KJV-like "the cause of Christ."
* Questions about wanting priest, baptism, etc. — traditional church-order formulas.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Call to awakening and recognition of need for true congregation.
* Assertion that all believers must participate.
* Illustration via mission work as communal responsibility.
* Ideal outcome: priest as encourager and teacher.
* Historical example (Hermannsburg) to provoke self-examination.
* Defense against charge of pride.
* Analogy between asking people to be Christians and to be congregation.
* Conclusion with rhetorical questions from church practice.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 5:14 — awakening.
* 1 Corinthians 12 — body with many members.
* Matthew 28 — mission implicit.
* Acts 2 — early Christian community.
* KJV diction suitable for "cause," "body," "awaken," "zeal."

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain urgent exhortation.
* Preserve moral pressure of rhetorical questions.
* Avoid softening calls to sacrifice and suffering.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "Det trænges" — rendered as "it is necessary," not optional.
* Imperatives and necessities kept strong.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → congregation.
* Sag → cause.
* Præst → minister.
* Kjærlighed/Nidkjærhed → love/zeal.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery preserved implicitly.
* Awakening imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in rebuke of passivity.
* Hope in vision of true congregation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Lists kept rhythmic and cumulative.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

We say no. It is necessary that we awaken and recognize that there is need of a congregation. It is necessary that there be the participation of all in the work; that there be earnest renunciation of the world, living love, burning zeal for the salvation of souls—not merely among the ministers, but among all the members of the congregation.

Spiritual interest must be awakened, nourished, and developed in all. It must not be so that, for example, the heathen mission is a minister’s affair, which the minister presses upon the congregation as a demand for sacrifice once a year or twice; but that it becomes dear and precious to each individual member of the congregation, from the child to the grey‑haired elder, so that they all love the cause, live for it, pray for it, suffer for it, read about it, save for it, and offer for it. All, all at work for the cause of Jesus Christ, so that the minister’s task becomes that of encouraging, urging, guiding, and instructing. Then the congregation has its true character; then the work is congregational.

Oh, how much greater power there would be if we became a congregation!

Has J. R. S. heard of Hermannsburg, where Harms was made an instrument to bring forth a congregation? Is it everywhere thus among us? If not, why not?

When we have then seen a very little grain of what the New Testament means by congregation, do we not then have the right to speak and testify concerning this matter? Is it pride to ask the people whether they do not desire to have it as the New Testament presents the Christian community on earth?

Surely it cannot be more prideful than to ask people whether they will be Christians. That does not mean that we can make them Christians; but it means that God can. So also with the congregation.

By the force of the old church order it has here among our Norwegian people been asked again and again: Will you have a minister? Will you have your children baptized? Will you have the Supper administered? Will you have the Word of God preached? Will you have the dead laid in the earth?
