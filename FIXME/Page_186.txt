STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hovmod" – pride in a moral–spiritual sense, not mere arrogance.
* "Dommesyge" – judgmentalism, a habitual readiness to judge others’ spiritual state.
* "Samvittigheden" – conscience as the God-addressed inner faculty.
* "Guds Riges Kraft og Drift" – the power and onward movement/impulse of God’s Kingdom; "Drift" has teleological force.
* "Menighed" – not merely congregation but Spirit-constituted ecclesial fellowship.
* "Aand" / "den Helligaand" – Spirit / Holy Spirit with full Trinitarian meaning.
* "Gode" / "Gave" – theological gift language.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with rhetorical pivots.
* Embedded rhetorical questions driving argument forward.
* Parallelisms linking Spirit and congregation.
* Semicolon logic that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: Menighed as Spirit-created body, not voluntary association.
* Pneumatology: receiving the Spirit as continual divine gift.
* Soteriological implication: dead heart, sleeping mind.
* Biblical gift theology (James 1:17; Acts 2; Ephesians 2).

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational and polemical tone.
* Appeals to conscience and spiritual urgency.
* Risk of flattening sermonic cadence into modern prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tveeggede Sværd" – two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12), God’s word piercing conscience.
* "sovende Sind og døde Hjerte" – biblical imagery of spiritual deadness.
* "Folkefrihed" vs. "Menighed" – political vs. ecclesial analogy.
* "Vil I ha’ Menighed?" – deliberately stark exhortational question.
* Gift language echoes James 1:17 (KJV diction appropriate).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Defense against accusation of pride/judgmentalism.
* Reframing the question from action for the people to participation of the people.
* Political analogy leading to ecclesial claim.
* Assertion: Menighed is God’s gift through the Spirit.
* Biblical grounding in Pentecost.
* Warning against empty claims of congregation without Spirit.
* Conclusion: legitimacy and necessity of asking whether people desire this gift.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Hebrews 4:12 – two-edged sword.
* James 1:17 – every good and perfect gift.
* Acts 2 – Pentecost, Spirit forming the church.
* Ephesians 4:4 / 2:22 – one body, one Spirit, dwelling of God.
* Luke 11:13 – God gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp rhetorical questions.
* Preserve rebuke and urgency.
* No softening of spiritual deadness imagery.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as must.
* Necessity of receiving the Spirit maintained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation/fellowship (kept consistent).
* Aand – Spirit; den Helligaand – the Holy Spirit.
* Gave – gift.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sword, dead heart, dwelling of God preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From polemic → teaching → exhortation → invitation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.
* Questions allowed to stand starkly.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

This was not pride, nor judgmentalism; it did not even touch the conscience directly. But when all this is taken together into a single question, and we do not merely ask whether something ought to be done for the people, but whether the people themselves will join in and do something for the power and forward movement of the Kingdom of God—then it is to be called pride and judgmentalism. Was it not the two-edged sword that touched the sleeping mind and the dead heart? Or why this bitterness?

What in politics is called popular liberty is in the Church called congregation. It signifies the participation of all in the work and the development, and in the sorrows and joys that follow therefrom. Is it truly wrong to agitate for that cause, even in the form of a question?

Will ye have congregation?

It has been called an irritating question; we would rather call it an uplifting question.

It is a good that is offered, and a gift which none can take except the one who receives it.

But every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

Therefore congregation also is a gift of God, a good and perfect gift, which God gives to those who have room for it.

For the congregation was not, before the Holy Spirit was poured out. The day the Spirit came upon the disciples in the upper room, those disciples became congregation.

If anyone says that they have congregation, but they do not have the Spirit, what profit is there in that? Is it God’s congregation?

If there is to be congregation among us, then we must receive the Spirit from God, so that we may become one body and one Spirit, a dwelling of God in the Spirit; so that if the Spirit is God’s gift, then the congregation is likewise.

Is it necessary for us to receive the Spirit? Or is it ever possible for anyone here on earth to have the Spirit in such a manner and to such a degree that he has no need to receive Him? All who have ever had the Spirit know this: that we have only so much Spirit as we receive. But God giveth the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.

Of all gifts this gift is the greatest. Why, then, should it be irritating to ask people whether they will have it?
