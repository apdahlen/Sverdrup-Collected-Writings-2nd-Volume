STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" used in a strong ecclesiological sense (congregation as the body of Christ, not merely an organization).
* "Kald" as divine vocation/calling, not employment or role.
* "Vidnepligt" implying moral and spiritual obligation to bear witness.
* "kjødeligt" meaning fleshly in Pauline-theological sense, not merely sensual.
* "hedensk" as pagan, opposed to Christian life, not cultural primitiveness.
* "død Prædiken" meaning spiritually dead preaching, not boring rhetoric.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long argumentative sentences with concessive pivots.
* Sermonic parallelism and cumulative clauses.
* Rhetorical questions functioning as indictments, not requests for information.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Relation between Word, Sacrament, and congregational responsibility.
* False peace, spiritual sleep, and self-deception.
* Ecclesial exclusivism condemned.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Moral rebuke directed at both clergy and laity.
* Prophetic warnings (“Ve dem”).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sove trygt og synde trygt" – idiom of false security; echoes prophetic warnings (cf. Amos 6:1).
* "dø i den falske Fred" – theological idiom of dying outside true reconciliation with God.
* "aabenbare Kristus i Verden" – Johannine and Pauline language (cf. 2 Cor. 4:10–11).
* "Aand og Sandhed" – direct echo of John 4:24 (KJV phrasing appropriate).
* "forkynde hans Dyder" – 1 Peter 2:9 (KJV: "shew forth the praises of him").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Refutation of a simplistic, fleshly understanding of the church’s calling.
* Clarification of the true purpose of the pastorate.
* Condemnation of false peace and negligent clergy.
* Assertion of the universal Christian calling to witness.
* Warning against illegitimate claims to exclusive church status.
* Series of probing ecclesiological questions.
* Final contrast between complacent self-satisfaction and true spiritual longing.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Peter 2:9 – called out of darkness into marvelous light.
* Philippians 1:27 – walking worthy of the gospel.
* John 4:24 – worship in spirit and in truth.
* Prophetic “Woe unto them” language (Isaiah, Jeremiah).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain severity in rebukes.
* Preserve prophetic lament and warning.
* Avoid conciliatory or therapeutic tone.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" – absolute impossibility.
* "skyldig" – moral obligation.
* "Ve dem" – divine threat, not mild warning.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Kald – calling
* Vidnesbyrd – witness/testimony
* Aand – Spirit
* Fred – peace (true vs. false)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleep vs. wakefulness as spiritual states.
* Fruit-bearing imagery retained.
* Light vs. darkness contrast preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp rebuke → sober warning → searching questions → longing prayer.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences with controlled rhythm.
* Preserve rhetorical repetition and question sequences.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Ah yes, it was simple enough—far too simple, low, fleshly, and heathenish! It is altogether true that without Word and Sacraments the congregation cannot fulfill its calling. But there is a better way for Christians to fulfill their duty of witness than to hire a man to do it in their stead. The congregation does not have a pastor in order that it itself may escape from its Christian duty and lay it upon the pastor. Rather, the congregation has a pastor so that the pastor may encourage, admonish, and spur the congregation on to true and living Christianity in heart, word, and deed.

Alas, it is perhaps not entirely unheard of that people have a pastor in order that they may sleep securely, sin securely, and die in false peace. And it happens, sadly, that there are pastors who do not see the people’s danger and therefore strengthen them in sleep and sin by a dead preaching; but thereby neither the task of the pastor nor that of the congregation is fulfilled.

The whole congregation, and every single member of it, is bound to walk worthily of Christ’s Gospel; and the whole congregation, and each of its members, is called to manifest Christ in the world by proclaiming his excellencies, who called them out of darkness into his marvelous light.

If, therefore, there are found among us organizations which call themselves congregations and dare to take God’s Word and Sacraments into use, then the responsibility of such organizations is as great and as holy as the name by which they have called themselves. Woe unto them if they have taken the name and do not answer to it. Worst of all, if they not only themselves lay claim to being a congregation, but even forbid others to be a congregation in that place where, under the name of congregation, they also claim the congregation’s right.

This has often been attempted among our people.

This, then, is the chief question: Do our congregations, as a general rule, correspond to the calling that lies in the name, the Body of Christ?

Is Christ manifested in the world through the testimony and walk of the congregations?

Do they do the works of Christ and nothing other than the works of Christ?

Do they bear all such fruits, and only such fruits, as are well-pleasing to God?

Or is there need of some change?

We indeed hear a great clamor from those who grumble and say: Here all is in order; here no change is needed, neither with us nor with our congregations.

But we also hear a sigh unto the Lord from the breast of those who long for congregation in Spirit and in truth: Pour out the Spirit upon us and upon our congregations, that we might become what we ought to be.
