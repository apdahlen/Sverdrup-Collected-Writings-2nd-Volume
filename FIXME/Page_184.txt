STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed – carries ecclesial and organic sense beyond modern “congregation”; implies living body.
* Aand / Liv – theological terms (Spirit/Life) with Johannine and Pauline resonance.
* Stiftelse – foundation/ordination; not merely institution.
* Raadnenhed – moral decay, corruption; stronger than mere “decay”.
* Lemmer – bodily members; Pauline metaphor must be preserved.
* Virksomhed – active operation, not generic activity.
* Fortabelse – perdition, eternal loss.
* Bogstaven / Aanden – Pauline law–Spirit contrast (2 Cor 3).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with layered clauses.
* Rhetorical questions that must retain force.
* Parallel contrasts (light/darkness; form/life).
* Quoted Scripture embedded mid-argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ.
* Pneumatology: work of the Holy Spirit.
* Works flowing from love, not formalism.
* Warning against dead orthodoxy.
* Ecclesiology in relation to state church.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation and rebuke must not be softened.
* Polemical edge against complacency.
* Pastoral urgency and prophetic warning.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Kristi Legeme” – Pauline idiom (1 Cor 12; Eph 1); KJV: “body of Christ”.
* “ved den Helligaand” – creedal phrase (Apostles’ Creed); implies divine agency.
* “Verdens Mørke / Raadnenhed” – Johannine and Matthean imagery (John 1; Matt 5).
* “Salt” – Matt 5:13; covenantal preservative image.
* “Herrens store Høst” – Matt 9:37–38.
* “Vuggesang” – metaphor for false comfort; literal rendering would obscure force.
* “Bogstaven uden Aanden” – 2 Cor 3:6.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church is truly the living Body of Christ through the Spirit.
* Support: Only the Holy Spirit can make the Church light, salt, and living labor.
* Appeal: Question to conscience—do you want true Church life?
* Rebuke: Condemnation of satisfaction with form without life.
* Warning: Scriptural judgment on dead churches.
* Contemporary Application: Critique of complacency within Lutheran state church.
* Climactic Question: Can the Church continue unchanged in new conditions?

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 12:27 – “Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”
* Matthew 5:13–14 – salt and light imagery.
* Revelation 3:1 – “thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.”
* Matthew 9:37–38 – harvest imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Rebukes retained without mitigation.
* Rhetorical questions translated directly.
* Urgency and seriousness preserved.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “kan ikke være uden” → “cannot be without”.
* “vil” / “maa” → preserved as volitional or necessary force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → Church
* Aand → Spirit
* Liv → Life
* Lemmer → Members
* Virksomhed → Work / Working

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery retained.
* Light/salt metaphors unchanged.
* Harvest metaphor preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp rebuke contrasted with earnest appeal.
* Consolation withheld intentionally.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Semicolon logic maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Church is the Body of Christ, filled with His Spirit and His Life, so that it both represents Christ’s own foundation and performs His work. “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”

We will mention no more than this one thing in this connection. It is this, namely, which cannot exist without “by the Holy Ghost.” It is the Spirit of God who works this miracle, that in the darkness of the world the Church is light; in the corruption of the world it is salt. It is the Spirit of God who makes the Church a gathering of laborers in the Lord’s great harvest, where each and every one is active in the great work of love: to gather in from the world’s perdition unto the Savior and His Kingdom.

Do you want Church? Does this question signify something evil? Or is there anyone who can answer: We have enough of that already? Ah no. We have not had enough of this yet. Nor can we here on earth ever have enough of it, or even too much. For the question plainly means this: Do you who in name and in form are a Church also desire the Church’s true Spirit and Life and Work, so that you are no longer merely paying members of an association which maintains church, pastor, and graveyard, but truly are spiritual members of the Body of Christ, active in His work of love upon the earth?

If anyone would answer: We already have this sufficiently, does that not mean that he is satisfied with the form without the life, and content with the letter without the Spirit?

For he who has begun to look into the truth of the divine rebuke: “I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead,” will surely acknowledge that it is most necessary to ask after the Church in spirit and in truth among us.

And when we think of how many there are among our churches and church-members who take firm comfort precisely from this cradle-song: All is in order, sleep in peace—then we are almost tempted to beg *Lutheraneren* and the Majority and J. R. S. at last to put an end to it.

The matter is this, that we stand in our ecclesiastical development directly before a great crisis, in which this is the question that must be answered: Is the old state-church order truly answering to the demand and need of our time and our land and our circumstances, or not? It may be all the same whether one holds the old church order to be sufficient or not in the old lands and the old times. We ask: Can the Lutheran Church solve her task here among us by continuing in the old tracks?
