STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed – carries ecclesiological weight (congregation as living spiritual body, not merely parish).
* Frikirken – Free Church movement; not merely a denomination but an ecclesial critique.
* Hovmod og Dommesyge – moral-theological terms (pride and censorious judgment), often weaponized rhetorically.
* Børnelærdom – catechism; specifically traditional Lutheran catechetical instruction.
* Salvelsens Aand og Maade – anointing of the Spirit and manner; experiential, pietistic nuance.
* Verdslige Kirke – worldly church; not neutral sociological descriptor but prophetic critique.
* Profeti / Profet – biblical-prophetic register; must retain Scriptural resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long hypotheticals with rhetorical questions.
* Irony sustained across paragraphs.
* Sermonic parallelism and repetition ("Fred, Fred!").
* Embedded biblical quotations requiring cadence preservation.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between nominal Christianity and living faith.
* Majority-argument as false assurance.
* Ecclesiology: true congregation arises where the Gospel does its full work.
* Prophetic critique vs. institutional self-satisfaction.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran-pietistic tone.
* Irony must remain sharp, not playful.
* Warnings must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Vil Du blive frisk?" – rhetorical question exposing absurd offense; parallels John 5:6.
* "sætte op en fornærmet Mine" – idiomatic: to take offense; tone must remain biting.
* "Majoritetens Ord" – majority opinion as worldly defense; echoes broad-road imagery (Matt. 7).
* "sov i Ro" – ironic lullaby; prophetic sarcasm.
* "Fred, Fred!" – Jeremiah 6:14; 8:11 (KJV diction required).
* "mit Folks Datters Brøst" – daughter of my people; must preserve biblical metaphor.
* "ihjelslagne" – slain; violent prophetic lament (Jer. 9:1).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening analogy: offended sick man.
* Application: offended majority when asked about true congregation.
* Ironical extension: catechism itself would be condemned as pride.
* Historical pattern: world rejects call to true Christianity.
* Identification of false prophecy of the worldly church.
* Contrast with true prophet and Scripture.
* Transition to Free Church aim.
* Conclusion: Gospel, not messengers, brings true congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 5:6 – "Wilt thou be made whole?"
* Jeremiah 6:14 / 8:11 – "Peace, peace; when there is no peace."
* Jeremiah 9:1 – prophet’s lament with tears.
* Implicit Matthew 7 – majority vs. truth.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain prophetic sharpness.
* Retain irony and rebuke.
* Preserve lament and warning without dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* maa – must.
* er – declarative certainty.
* er ingen – categorical negation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Evangeliet – the Gospel.
* Kristendom – Christianity.
* Profet – prophet.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleep imagery.
* Daughter of my people.
* Gospel bringing forth congregation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Irony → warning → lament → exhortation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences.
* Semicolon pivots.
* Proclamatory rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Or if we were to ask a sick man: Wilt thou be made whole?—could the sick man then put on an offended countenance and answer: Thou speakest as though there were no healthy people among us?

J. R. S. must, if indeed he means anything other than to be coarse, mean this: that the question, Will ye have congregation? is superfluous everywhere, because everywhere there is congregation among us. There is no need for change, for everywhere among the majority of the people the congregation is truly congregation; it answers to its name; it is mere “pride and censoriousness” if anyone thinks that the congregations are not at all—perhaps never—everything they ought to be and could be.

Then it must surely also be “pride and censoriousness,” what stands written in our catechism concerning “the Christians”:

“The name indeed they all have, but the Spirit and manner of the anointing most of them lack.”

The world has always fended off the demand for true and living Christianity precisely with this word of the majority: We have all this already in order; it is only pride and censoriousness that make some think that we are not all good Christians together.

This is the false prophecy of the worldly church, at all times and in all places like unto itself. Here is peace and no danger. Our Christianity is good, our doctrine is pure, our Christians are good Christians, and our congregations are good congregations. Dear people, sleep in peace, sleep in peace!

But what says the true prophet? From the Lord he says with piercing earnestness: Ye heal the hurt of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. And of himself the true prophet says: Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.

Let us look a little at the meaning of that for which the Free Church labors; then perhaps it will show itself that the question after congregation is not unjustified in our midst, and that there is more pride in boasting that all is in order than in acknowledging that we are sorely lacking in being what we ought to be.

Perhaps, if J. R. S. were allowed to see what congregation is, he would no longer come with foolish jests about “the Free Church’s emissaries” being supposed to bring it along with them. He knows well that there is no one who believes anything of the sort; but we do indeed believe that the Gospel brings it with it, wherever it is permitted to do its work in full.
