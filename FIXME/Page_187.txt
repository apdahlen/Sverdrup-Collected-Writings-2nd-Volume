STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Aand" (Spirit): must retain capitalized theological sense (Holy Spirit), not generic "spirit."
* "Menighed": congregation/church as living body; not merely institution.
* "Kjødet": Pauline "the flesh" (sinful nature), not physical body.
* "Kaar og Kald": condition/lot and calling/vocation; must keep dual nuance.
* "Besøgelsens Tid": biblical phrase (time of visitation).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with semicolons and parallelisms.
* Rhetorical questions driving exhortation.
* Balanced antitheses (Spirit brings blessing and conflict).

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of sanctification through suffering and cross-bearing.
* Spiritual warfare imagery (devil, hell).
* Ecclesiology: church as suffering, active body of Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Warning against false security.
* Biblical cadence must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kamp mod Kjødet": Galatians 5; struggle against sinful nature.
* "Lidelsens og Korsets Bane": following Christ in suffering (Luke 9:23).
* "søge efter det fortabte": Luke 19:10.
* "Fred og Tryghed": 1 Thessalonians 5:3 ("Peace and safety").
* "sat en aaben Dør": Revelation 3:8.
* "Besøgelsens Tid": Luke 19:44.

KJV diction naturally fits these echoes and should be used.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Desiring Spirit and congregation entails cost.
* Support: The Spirit brings both blessings and conflict.
* Definition: True congregation is active, suffering love.
* Christological grounding: As Head, so body.
* Warning: False security of a sleeping church.
* Contemporary appeal: Present moment is opportune.
* Climactic question repeated: "Will you have congregation?"
* Transition to definition question.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 5 (Spirit vs. flesh).
* Luke 9:23; 19:10.
* 1 Thessalonians 5:3.
* Revelation 3:8.
* Luke 19:44; Isaiah 55:6.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warnings without mitigation.
* Preserve earnest appeals and rhetorical force.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "bør betænke" → "ought to consider."
* "maa" implications rendered as necessity.
* No weakening of obligation or inevitability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand = Spirit.
* Menighed = congregation.
* Kjødet = the flesh.
* Kristi Efterfølgelse = following of Christ.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body and members imagery retained.
* Door, visitation, battle imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warning; hope in opportunity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long clauses and rhythmic parallelism.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But those who answer: Yes, we gladly desire Spirit and congregation, ought to consider what this entails. For the Spirit of God brings with Him all good—righteousness, peace, joy, and all blessed fruits; but the Spirit of God also brings with Him conflict with the flesh, enmity with the world, the raging wrath of the devil and of hell. The Spirit of God is a Spirit who drives to the following of Christ upon the path of suffering and of the cross, and who constrains, by the power of God’s love, to seek after that which is lost and to labor for the salvation of souls.

Therefore the congregation is no fellowship of sloth and ease. It is the living, contending, and suffering fellowship of love.

As the Head, so the body; as the body, so the members. If Christ has loved, labored, sacrificed, and suffered, then His body and bride must be prepared for the same. To love Him, to labor with Him, to sacrifice oneself for Him, to suffer with Him—this is the congregation’s condition and calling.

Is it then so foolish to ask: Will you have congregation? Or is it so certain that we may content ourselves with the sleep-inducing speech: We have congregation already; there is no need for anyone to come to us and speak of congregation. It has been the custom of the sleeping congregation in all ages to comfort itself with the thought that all is in order. But it has always been a false comfort, and therefore the Scripture says: When they shall say, Peace and safety! then sudden destruction cometh upon them.

Wisely, the question is justified now as at all times. And we dare to add: it is all the more justified, inasmuch as there is all the greater occasion to obtain congregation. The outward hindrances which barred the congregation’s unfolding and manifestation have been swept away; God has set an open door before His people. There is a time of visitation among us, when the Lord is to be found by those who seek Him, and is near to those who call upon Him. It seems to us that never has the question been more timely:

Will you have congregation?

What is congregation?

It is indeed a delight to be permitted to ask this. For the whole New Testament aims precisely at this: that there should come to be congregation.
