STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Frikirke – not merely “free church” in modern evangelical sense; denotes a Lutheran congregation free from state control.
* Menighed – congregation as a living spiritual body, not merely an administrative unit.
* Præstemagt – clerical power or sacerdotal dominance; polemical.
* Embede – ecclesiastical office; must not be flattened into “job” or “position.”
* Verdensretfærdiggjørelsen – doctrine of objective/world justification; technical Lutheran term.
* Lægmandsvirksomheden – lay activity/ministry; doctrinally loaded.
* Absolutionslæren – doctrine of absolution; tied to means of grace.
* Naadestolen – mercy seat; biblical cultic imagery.
* Aanderne – spirits; biblical testing language.
* Bekjendelses Grund – confessional foundation; refers to Lutheran Confessions.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation.
* Rhetorical questions that must remain intact.
* Parallel accusatory clauses (“det er mod … det er mod …”).

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of church authority, congregation vs clergy.
* Means of grace, absolution, justification.
* Right and authority of the believing congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest polemical Lutheran tone.
* Collective confessional “we.”
* Exhortational and combative rhetoric that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Vi staar paa en vanskelig og farefuld Plads” – metaphor of standing in peril; should remain vivid.
* “Tvangstrøie af Læresætninger” – straitjacket of doctrines; strong polemical image.
* “viljeløs Masse i Præstens Haand” – image of domination.
* “prøve Aanderne” – 1 John 4:1.
* “Naadestolen i Jesu Blod” – Hebrews/Romans imagery; mercy seat through Christ’s blood.
* “slaa af eller gaa paa Akkord” – not yield or compromise.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Historical claim: lack of precedent for Lutheran free churches.
* Acknowledgment of difficulty and conflict.
* Identification of the central struggle: clerical power vs congregational freedom.
* Critique of “Wisconsinism” as preserving state-church priestly dominance.
* Enumeration of doctrines viewed as attacks on congregational life.
* Assertion that the controversy concerns the essence and authority of the congregation.
* Refusal to compromise; openness to theological disputation.
* Conclusion: the struggle is solely about the free, living congregation and its edification.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* “prøve Aanderne” – 1 John 4:1.
* “Naadestolen” – Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9.

* Embede – office.
* Naade – grace.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Realism about danger.
* Combative middle section.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There has not yet, for any extended period of time, existed anywhere a Lutheran Free Church. From the earliest days of the Church there have been only very few and very small Christian free churches, persecuted and despised. We therefore stand upon a difficult and perilous ground. Young and inexperienced, so weak and fragile, we are to seek the true form of the Lutheran Free Church. Is it any wonder that there are difficulties and dissension? A great work can never be accomplished without many and severe struggles. But the greatest conflict must arise between priestly power and congregational freedom. The lordly conception, inherited through centuries, which church government and bishops and priests have exercised within the Church, cannot yield to a true and inward cooperation between congregation and office without costing a struggle. Equilibrium cannot be restored again without perilous rending. In these rendings we live, and we do not deceive ourselves when we expect that they will continue yet for some time.

It is our conviction that all that we gather together under the term Wisconsinism is an attempt, within the Free Church, to preserve the priestly power of the Norwegian State Church by means of a straitjacket of doctrinal propositions, all of which aim at one goal: to make the congregation into a will-less mass in the hand of the priest. Against the free, living congregation, the doctrine of world-justification is the most violent assault; against the congregation’s self-edification, the Wisconsin doctrine of lay activity is directed; against the congregation’s unhindered and unmediated access to the mercy seat in the blood of Jesus, the doctrine of absolution is aimed; against the congregation’s right to test the spirits by God’s Word, the assertion that the pure doctrine is God’s Word comes into conflict. It is because these doctrines and propositions stand in the way of the free congregation’s development among us that we exert so much force in combating them.

It is the congregation that is at stake: what it is, and what right and authority it possesses. And because this is our conviction, therefore we cannot relent or enter into compromise. We gladly desire to confer concerning these matters with our opponents; we gladly wish to test whether our conviction is well grounded. We also desire opportunity to contend orally for the same cause for which we write. But this we believe is the advantage which the “open declaration” has brought us in the struggle: that it has become ever more clear that that about which the struggle turns, that which is at stake, is nothing other than—the congregation, the free, living, believing, and witnessing congregation.

And concerning how we may labor best for the congregation, how we may promote its good, how the blood and death of Jesus may rightly be preached for the salvation of men—concerning these things it is that we desire to confer with all those among our countrymen in America who stand upon the ground of the Lutheran Confession.
