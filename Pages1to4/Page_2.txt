STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Strid" – carries theological and ecclesial weight (churchly conflict), not mere quarrel.
* "Konferentsen" – historical ecclesial body; avoid modern administrative connotations.
* "Menigheden" – congregation as living church body, not simply local membership.
* "Præstevældets Undergang" – loaded term implying clerical domination, not neutral clergy.
* "Frikirke" – free church in a 19th-century Lutheran-American context.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, balanced sentences with parallel clauses and antitheses.
* Semicolon logic guiding argument progression.
* Rhetorical questions driving moral inquiry.

Theological Hazards:

* Understanding of church as militant/struggling ("stridende Kirke").
* Sinfulness vs necessity of conflict.
* Responsibility before God rather than polemical victory.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, pastoral seriousness.
* Address to collective conscience ("vi spørger os selv").
* Avoid journalistic or neutral academic tone.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kirken er stridende" – echoes the concept of the Church Militant.
* "tilintetgjøre Guds Kirke" – biblical gravity; destruction of God's Church.
* "Legnene til en bedre Dag" – signs/earnest of a better day (cf. biblical "pledge" imagery).
* "Vi spørger ikke efter" – idiomatic: we do not concern ourselves with.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: The conflict is intensifying.
* Emotional responses: joy and sorrow, from differing motives.
* Dismissal of emotional reactions as inevitable.
* Central question posed: What is the conflict truly about?
* Moral self-examination: Are we contending rightly?
* Conditional reasoning: If unnecessary, stop; if necessary yet sinful, repent.
* Thesis conclusion: The struggle concerns the congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Church as enduring conflict – echoes Ephesians 6, Church Militant theology.
* Destruction of God's Church – Matthew 16:18 resonance.
* Self-examination and repentance – Pauline moral exhortation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain seriousness and gravity.
* Preserve moral urgency without polemical excess.
* Keep communal "we" intact.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan" rendered with full necessity and moral force (must, cannot).
* Conditional constructions preserved without softening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Strid = conflict/struggle (consistent).
* Kirke = Church (capitalized).
* Menighed = congregation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Church as engaged in struggle.
* Conflict as something that can be sinful even if necessary.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Joy vs sorrow.
* Hope vs fear.
* Determination vs humility.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Rhetorical questions preserved.
* Clause rhythm respected.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

1. What Is at Stake?

Source: Quarterly Journal for the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. Edited by Prof. Sverdrup and Oftedal. Third Year (Vol. III), 1877. Pages 110–112. — Ed.

The conflict that is being waged between the Synod and the Conference is beginning to grow more animated once again. No one can fail to see this—some with joy, some with heartfelt sorrow; some rejoice over the conflict, because they believe it will bring about the destruction of God’s Church; some mourn over it for the very same reason. Some take pleasure in the conflict, because in it they discern the tokens of a better day for the young Free Church; some lament it, because it must end in the downfall of clerical dominion. We do not concern ourselves with these moods and feelings; we know that they must accompany ecclesiastical development everywhere, and have accompanied it from the Church’s earliest days. We do not believe that the conflict can cease so long as the Church is a church in conflict; but we ask this: what is it that is being contended over, what is it that is being fought for? We ask ourselves whether we are contending rightly; for the manner in which our opponents conduct their struggle, they themselves bear the responsibility, and we are not set to judge them. What is at stake? If it is an unnecessary strife, then we will put an end to it; if it is a necessary strife, then it is also a sinful strife, and we will repent of it. Our settled conviction is this: that in this conflict what is at stake— is the congregation.
