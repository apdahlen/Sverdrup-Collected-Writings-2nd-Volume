STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Fordærvelsen" — not mere moral decay, but ecclesial corruption with doctrinal weight.
* "Kirken" vs. "Menigheden" — technical theological distinction; must not be collapsed into modern sociological terms.
* "Geistligheden" — clerical estate, not simply clergy as a profession.
* "Lægfolk" — laity, but with polemical force implying dispossession.
* "Herlighed" — glory with biblical resonance, not prestige.
* "Kraft" — spiritual power/efficacy, not influence.
* "Bekjendelsesskrifterne" — Lutheran Confessional Writings; must retain confessional authority.
* "Virvar" — chaotic confusion, doctrinal muddle.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal chains.
* Sermonic cadence relying on repetition and accumulation.
* Rhetorical pivots introduced by "men" and "kun".
* Passive constructions that distribute responsibility.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church (ecclesiology): identity of Church and congregation.
* Authority, power, and responsibility in spiritual leadership.
* Sin of false mediation and usurpation of spiritual authority.
* Biblical image of blind guides leading the blind.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational and accusatory tone must not be softened.
* Polemical sharpness toward clericalism and princely power.
* Historical judgment spoken with prophetic seriousness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "død og begraven" — idiom of total eradication; echoes biblical death imagery.
* "Blindes blinde Veiledere" — direct echo of Matthew 15:14 (KJV: "the blind lead the blind").
* "satte Ordets Lys paa Lysestagen" — Matthew 5:15; Word restored to rightful proclamation.
* "fæstede sig i Fyrsternes Arme" — metaphor of political dependence and compromise.
* "Opblussen" — brief flare or awakening, not lasting reform.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Assertion of continuous corruption after a historical turning point.
* Sharp distinction between Church as clergy and the erased congregation.
* Moral judgment on clerical usurpation and silencing of the people.
* Reformation as doctrinal correction of ecclesiology.
* Failure of Lutheran Church to embody its own doctrine.
* Explanation through political entanglement with princes.
* Final contrast between papal and royal domination with identical effect.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 15:14 — blind guides.
* Matthew 5:15 — light on the candlestick.
* Implicit Pauline ecclesiology: Church as body, congregation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain accusatory and lamenting tone.
* Preserve prophetic judgment without mitigation.
* Keep historical narrative as moral indictment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "er" as definitive theological assertion.
* "maa" implied necessity in responsibility and consequence.
* No weakening of inevitability or culpability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirken → Church
* Menigheden → Congregation
* Kraft → power
* Sandhed → truth
* Naade → grace

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve imagery of inheritance, burial, blindness, light, and sleep.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in corruption narrative.
* Brief hope in Reformation clarity.
* Renewed severity in failure and relapse.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences with commas and semicolons.
* Preserve rhythmic repetition and cumulative clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

From this time onward the corruption is unceasing. From now on it is an established fact and a manifest reality that the “Church” is one thing, and the Congregation something altogether different. The Church is the clergy; the Congregation is nothing at all. One soon ceases even to speak of it. It is dead and buried. The clergy have inherited all its power, all its right, all its glory, all its divine truth and force. “The people” — they have become “the laity.” It is superfluous to recall how matters proceeded further along this slippery path, until clergy and laity alike, by this false relation, stood equally far removed from Christianity and its power. Only this must always be remembered: that the heaviest responsibility here, as always, rests upon the blind guides of the blind.

The Lutheran Reformation also brought clarity to this question concerning the Church and the Congregation. And for Luther it became a settled certainty that the Church was nothing other than the Congregation. And had it not been for the grace of the Lord, which once more set the light of the Word upon the candlestick, we should even now not have known the name of the Congregation, but would still be clinging to the old Catholic confusion concerning “clergy” and “laity,” which to this day still haunts the minds and hearts of so many.

But as clear and definite as the fundamental thoughts of the Reformation were on this point, and as directly and firmly as they are expressed in the Confessional Writings themselves, so little did the Lutheran Church succeed in carrying the confessed truth through into life. It is of little use here to ask: why? There are many things that speak in mitigation of the weakness of which the Lutheran Church made itself guilty, and perhaps none of us would have shown greater courage; but the naked truth is this: that the Lutheran Church fastened itself in the arms of the princes, and the princes gladly received the increase of power which they thereby obtained; and what was not given them willingly, that they later took in spite of the Church’s protest.

In this way it came to pass that, after a brief kindling of the thought of the Congregation’s freedom and of the true nature of the Church, the consciousness of the Congregation again sank down into the depths of sleep and forgetfulness, and once more the old notion of “the Church” arose as an authority over the Congregation — with this sole difference, that it was now the king and the royal officials who were the Church and exercised its power, whereas before it was the pope and the bishops who were the Church and had robbed the Congregation of its power.
