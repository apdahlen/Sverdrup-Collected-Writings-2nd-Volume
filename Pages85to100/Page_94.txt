STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Forening / Samfund: carry ecclesiological weight beyond mere “association” or “society”; must be rendered with care (often “association,” “body,” or “church body” depending on context).
* Kald: vocational and divine calling; not merely “profession.”
* Aandsdrevne: literally “Spirit-driven,” implying governance by the Holy Spirit.
* Herskesyge, Vinding, Ære: morally charged vices (lust for power, gain, honor) with biblical resonance.
* Menighed / Guds Menighed: congregation vs. the people of God; must remain distinct.
* Forjættelse: biblical “promise,” covenantal in tone.
* Klippen: metaphor with clear Matthean resonance; must not be paraphrased.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long periodic sentences with concessive clauses (“hvor meget end … saa er det dog …”).
* Heavy use of parallelism and antithesis.
* Sermonic cadence with semicolons and pivots that should not be modernized into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between clergy-driven structures and Spirit-grounded congregational life.
* Doctrine of the Church’s foundation and perseverance.
* Implicit ecclesiology opposing clericalism.
* Spiritual corruption framed as demonic assault.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation addressed to conscience.
* Warning tone must not be softened.
* Historical examples used as moral proof, not neutral history.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “opofret for sit Kald” – self-sacrificial devotion to divine vocation.
* “aandsdrevne Mænd” – men governed by the Holy Spirit (cf. Rom. 8).
* “Drivfjære” – driving force or spring; metaphorical, mechanical image.
* “rives itu” – violently torn apart; ecclesial schism imagery.
* “Fordærvelsens Strøm” – stream/flood of corruption; echoes biblical flood and moral decay imagery.
* “gribe i sin egen Barm” – examine one’s own heart; idiomatic self-examination.
* “sætter Livet ind derpaa” – staking one’s life upon a calling; total commitment.

KJV-leaning equivalents are available for “calling,” “Spirit,” “promise,” “the rock,” “the devil,” “the storms of time.”

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Concession: Even the most devoted clergy-led associations are historically fragile.
* Claim: Such Spirit-filled periods are rare and brief.
* Cause of decline: Human vices supplant the Spirit and Christ’s call.
* Consequences: Schism or wholesale corruption.
* Historical example: The Roman Catholic Church’s failed attempts (clerical and monastic).
* Thesis: Only God’s congregation, built on the Rock, has the promise of permanence.
* Application: Norwegian-American Lutheran context suffers from clergy-dominated structures.
* Appeal: Self-examination by each church body.
* Conclusion/exhortation: True free church requires congregations forming the body in brotherly cooperation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* “built upon the Rock” – Matthew 16:18; Matthew 7:24–25.
* “storms” and “the devil’s cunning assaults” – Ephesians 6; 1 Peter 5:8.
* “calling” – Pauline vocational theology (1 Cor. 7; Eph. 4).
* “promise to stand forever” – eschatological permanence of God’s people (Heb. 12:28).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings about corruption and clerical ambition must remain severe.
* Historical critique must remain morally charged.
* Exhortation to labor “early and late” must retain urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa” – must (necessity), not “should.”
* “kan” in negative constructions – inability, not mere improbability.
* Conditional constructions retain firmness, not tentativeness.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kald – “calling.”
* Menighed – “congregation.”
* Samfund – “church body” or “association,” context-dependent.
* Guds Aand – “the Spirit of God.”

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Mechanical metaphors (springs, driving forces) preserved.
* Violent tearing imagery preserved.
* Storm and assault imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Move from lament → warning → historical proof → exhortation.
* Hopeful confidence only at the end, grounded in divine calling.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained with semicolons.
* Parallel clauses preserved.
* Suitable for proclamation rather than silent reading.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The fact of the matter is this: however much an association of pastors may, for a time, be wholly and entirely devoted to its calling, however much it may uplift a community to have none but Spirit-driven men as pastors, yet it is a sorrowful experience that such times are both few and short, and that therefore there soon come times when the lust for dominion, for gain, and for honor becomes a stronger driving force than the Spirit of God and the call of Christ—now in fewer, now in more. At times the community is then torn asunder by strife and factions; at times the whole is swept away in an unceasing stream of corruption. There is a church body that has attempted this; it is the Roman Catholic Church. It soon made the experience that the priesthood degenerated; then it resorted to associations of laymen in monastic orders; but these too degenerated in the same manner. There is only one association that has the promise of standing forever, when it is built upon the Rock; it is the congregation of God. And if the church body is not formed from the congregations, then it will never stand amid the storms of time and against the devil’s cunning assaults.

Short as Norwegian-American church history is, it may nevertheless already offer to the attentive observer many proofs of the corrupting nature of the fact that the formation of church bodies in almost all cases has been almost exclusively a matter of the clergy. In part the church bodies are drawn, consciously or unconsciously, toward the old church road; in part they hover in an unbroken danger of being torn apart and split asunder by personal passions and clerical quarrels. There is presumably no need of any further demonstration of either the one or the other; let each church body lay its hand upon its own breast and see whether it is not true.

It is therefore certain that if we Norwegian Lutherans in America, few as we are, are truly to be able to form a free church body, then it must more and more come to this, that it is the congregations which form the church body. Toward this end there must be labor, early and late, by pastors and by members of the congregations, by laymen and by the learned, in a true brotherhood and in full confidence. And we are more than sufficiently many, if we truly serve this goal as a calling from the Lord, and go to the work with that strength which the Lord willingly gives to those who follow His call and stake their lives upon it.
