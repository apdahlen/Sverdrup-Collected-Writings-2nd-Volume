STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Samfund" — carries ecclesial meaning (church body/synod), not merely "society".
* "Bekjendelse" — confession in the doctrinal, creedal Lutheran sense.
* "Menighed" — congregation as a spiritual body, not merely an assembly.
* "Grunden / Grundvold" — foundational metaphor with biblical resonance (cf. 1 Cor. 3).
* "Vildfarelse" — doctrinal error, not simple mistake.
* "Trældom" — spiritual bondage, Pauline overtones.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered causal clauses.
* Heavy use of semicolons and explanatory pivots.
* Sermonic parallelism that must not be broken into modern short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church (ecclesiology).
* Authority of Scripture and Sacraments.
* Nature and function of Confessions.
* Relation between truth, error, witness, and confession.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical yet pastoral Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and churchly experience.
* Risk of flattening strong rebukes into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "staar saaledes allerede ved Ordet og Sakramenterne" — idiom meaning "stands already united through Word and Sacrament".
* "Vidner for ... og mod ..." — confessional formula echoing biblical witness language (cf. John 5).
* "Børnelærdommen" — catechetical instruction; echoes Luther’s Small Catechism.
* "male udenpaa Lænten" — vivid idiom: painting over chains; false appearance of purity.

KJV Parallels:

* "foundation" (1 Cor. 3:11)
* "bondage" (Gal. 5)
* "bear witness" (John 1:7)

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Restatement of foundation and goal of church fellowship.
* Clarification of what "Lutheran confessional ground" truly means.
* Distinction between universal Christian unity and Lutheran confessional unity.
* Defense of the necessity of confession against error.
* Critique of clerical overreach in demanding extra-confessional doctrinal agreement.
* Warning against false unity that results in spiritual bondage.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Foundation imagery — 1 Corinthians 3:11.
* Witness/confession — Romans 10:10; John 1:7.
* Truth vs. falsehood — Johannine dualism.
* Bondage vs. freedom — Galatians 5:1.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical clarity against doctrinal overreach.
* Preserve seriousness of warning against "Trældom" and "indre Usandhed".

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must" not "should".
* "kan ikke" rendered as "cannot" not "may not".

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Bekjendelse → Confession
* Menighed → Congregation
* Samfund → Church fellowship / synodical fellowship
* Sandhed → Truth
* Vildfarelse → Error

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Foundation imagery retained.
* Chains/painting metaphor preserved verbatim.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm doctrinal exposition → sharp critique → solemn warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.
* Semicolon pivots retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

We have already mentioned both the foundation upon which such a fellowship must be built and the goal toward which it strives. It is proper at once to say that when it is declared of such a fellowship that it rests upon the ground of the Lutheran Confession, this is because the congregation builds upon God’s Word, and upon that alone; and it thus already stands, through the Word and the Sacraments, in fellowship with the whole Christian Church throughout the entire world, which is built upon the same foundation. But when Lutheran congregations are to form fellowship with one another, then the common bond which unites precisely this fellowship is the Lutheran Confession.

All Christian congregations are agreed upon the great common foundation of the whole Church, God’s Word and His Sacraments; the Lutheran congregations which unite themselves into a fellowship are also agreed in the truth that the Lutheran Church has attained the deepest and fullest understanding of the content of God’s Word in its Confession. As long as Christ’s Church has been upon the earth, it has always had to contend with falsehood and error; and just as it lies in the very nature and character of faith that it must bring forth testimony and confession, so it also belongs necessarily to true and genuine faith that it not only bears witness to the truth, but also bears witness against error, against falsehood. Thus it is also the case that the Lutheran Church, through its Confession, bears witness both for the truth which it has recognized, and against the error which it has seen within Christendom; and it is this Confession which is the bond of union of the Lutheran Church fellowship.

It is therefore a necessary requirement of Lutheran congregations which wish to form fellowship that they truly, and with full conviction, adhere to the simple Lutheran Confession. When, in the Norwegian Synod, one has wished to go beyond this and to demand agreement also in doctrinal propositions which go far beyond, and in part far away from, the Lutheran Confession, this is a deviation which doubtless arises from the fact that the entire fellowship is so essentially a clerical fellowship that it forgets that the congregation cannot make its own confession, and cannot adopt doctrines, which a handful of pastors agree upon at an annual meeting or a pastors’ conference. That which is to bind the congregations together must be the old truth, well tested in the living experience of the Church, which through catechetical instruction has also become the personal experience and spiritual possession of each individual Christian. To attempt to bind any other bond upon the congregation and the congregations—this becomes bondage and inward untruth, however much one may paint upon the chains: “This is the pure doctrine.” The whole matter is and remains a complete misunderstanding, both of the significance of the Confession and of the nature of the congregation and of the fellowship.
