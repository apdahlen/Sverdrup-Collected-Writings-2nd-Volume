STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Rige" as Kingdom with biblical resonance, not merely realm or state.
* "Huusholdning" in a theological sense: God's household, economy, stewardship.
* "Aand" / "aandeligt" contrasted with "Verdens Aand" – Spirit vs. worldliness.
* "Kald" as divine calling or vocation.
* "Menighed" and "Samfund" overlapping but distinct ecclesial nuances.
* "Saliggjørelses Fyrste" as a Christological title with Heb. 2 resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered relative clauses and repeated anaphora ("det Samfund, som...").
* Sermonic cadence driven by commas and semicolons rather than short sentences.
* Parallel constructions that must remain parallel in English.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Kingdom of God overruling earthly kingdoms.
* Ecclesiology: openness vs. sectarian pride.
* Mission, universal scope of salvation, and sacrificial discipleship.
* Christ’s suffering, exaltation, and leading believers into glory.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, admonishing tone addressed to conscience.
* Sharp warnings against spiritual pride and false security.
* Elevated sermonic register that must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "udkaste sit Garn saa vidt som Havet" – gospel mission imagery from the Gospels (e.g., Matt. 13).
* "raadne Fisk" – bad fish; warning that impurity in the visible church is unavoidable.
* "Maal og Mærke" – measure and standard; self-made criterion for Christianity.
* "Op til Kronen" – toward the crown, echoing eschatological reward (Rev. imagery).
* "Seierens Maal" – goal of victory; Christian perseverance imagery.
  KJV diction naturally supports "Kingdom," "crown," "glory," "Prince," "sufferings," "children."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: God’s Kingdom overthrows all worldly kingdoms and must shape all Christian communities.
* Critique of false "greatness" rooted in worldly spirit and means.
* Positive call: labor in Christlike love for the salvation of all.
* Series of condemnations of exclusionary, proud, self-satisfied communities.
* Vision of the true Christian community: universal, fearless, faith-driven.
* Concluding maxim on greatness determined by the greatness of one’s goal.
* Christological climax: Christ’s suffering, exaltation, and call to total devotion.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Daniel 2 / Matthew 13: the Kingdom filling the earth.
* Gospel parables of the net and the fish.
* Hebrews 2:10 – "bringing many sons unto glory," Prince of salvation perfected through sufferings.
* Philippians 2:9 – "a name above every name."
* Revelation imagery of crown and victory.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain uncompromising rebukes of pride and narrowness.
* Preserve fearless, confident faith language despite death and opposition.
* Maintain exhortational urgency without sentimentality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa have" rendered as "must have."
* "vover" rendered as "dares," not "tries."
* Absolute conditions ("ellers duer det ikke") retained without mitigation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Rige → Kingdom
* Samfund → community / fellowship (contextually consistent)
* Menighed → congregation
* Tro → faith
* Herlighed → glory

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fishing net imagery preserved literally.
* Crown, goal, victory, and journey metaphors retained.
* Spatial imagery (ends of the earth, between us and the crown) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp denunciation followed by calm confidence in faith.
* Severe warnings contrasted with triumphant Christological hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Repetition and anaphora maintained.
* Semicolon logic respected.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

God’s Kingdom overthrows all the kingdoms of the world; it fills the whole earth. Every Christian community must bear within itself this nature of God’s Kingdom, otherwise it is of no use in the Lord’s household. One often calls the work “a great community,” and it is right to call such work great, if it is a spiritual work, a work in the spirit of the world and with the world’s means. Yet it also belongs to God’s calling in the lands to labor in the inward love of Christ for the salvation of all men. That community which settles down in the thought that we are many enough; that which, in particularity and pride, will have no others with it than those whom it can mark with its own mark and stamp as its own; that community which will have only those with it who possess a certain stature and a certain experience and a certain learning, which it itself has taken as the measure and standard of Christianity; that community which will not cast its net as wide as the sea and draw the net, even though there should be rotten fish in the catch—that community does not have the true love of God and the perfect mind of Christ. Toward the crown and out to the ends of the world the Christian community, like the Christian congregation, casts its gaze; and even though it knows that death lies between us and the crown, and that heathendom and the coldness of the world lie between us and the goal of victory, yet it is calm and unafraid—in faith.

He who sets himself a small goal becomes small; he who takes a great goal becomes great by his goal; but he who dares to stake everything upon the eternal goal, who dares to give up all earthly goals in order to attain the heavenly, he becomes greater than all. The Prince of our salvation has, through the suffering of death, bound to himself a name above every name; and he is also the one who leads his children into the same glory, if they dare all, surrender all, sacrifice all in order to win him.
