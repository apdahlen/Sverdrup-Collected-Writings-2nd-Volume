STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" / "Menighederne": Congregation(s) as concrete ecclesial bodies, not abstract community.
* "Samfund": Church fellowship/association; not generic society.
* "Bekjendelse": Confession in the doctrinal, confessional sense.
* "Opbyggelse": Edification/building up in a spiritual, ecclesial sense.
* "Ordets Udbredelse": The spread/proclamation of the Word, not mere dissemination.
* "Lægfolket": The laity; carries polemical weight against clericalism.
* "Kirkesamfund": Church body/denomination.
* "Præstevælde": Clerical domination; polemically opposed to Lutheran ecclesiology.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered causal clauses.
* Sermonic repetitions (“kun der… kun der…”).
* Parenthetical clarifications and rhetorical accumulations.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Distinction between means and ends of the Church.
* Kingdom of God language.
* Anti-clericalism without anti-ministerialism.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, corrective tone aimed at conscience.
* Polemical urgency against entrenched prejudice.
* Ecclesial seriousness; must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Arbeidere i Herrens Vingaard": Biblical idiom (Matt. 20); workers in the Lord’s vineyard.
* "levende Sten": 1 Peter 2 imagery; living stones in God’s temple.
* "Guds Riges Komme": The coming of the Kingdom of God (Lord’s Prayer).
* "Verdens Ende": Matt. 28:20; eschatological horizon of mission.
* KJV equivalents provide natural resonance for these expressions.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Premise: Any church fellowship must rest on unity of faith/confession and defined ecclesial aims.
* Definition: The Lutheran Confession as ground; edification and mission as aims.
* Warning: Any other aims lead to false and destructive striving.
* Central Question: Who is to form such a fellowship?
* Refutation: The prejudice that only clergy are workers.
* Assertion: Priesthood and calling of every believer.
* Conclusion: True church fellowship arises only where congregations themselves awaken and unite.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matt. 20 – Workers in the vineyard.
* 1 Peter 2 – Living stones, spiritual house.
* Matt. 28:19–20 – Mission to the end of the world.
* Lord’s Prayer – “Thy kingdom come.”

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against false aims remain uncompromised.
* Polemic against clericalism remains explicit.
* Exhortation to active congregational life remains urgent.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must" consistently.
* Necessity and obligation preserved without mitigation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Samfund – fellowship
* Bekjendelse – confession
* Opbyggelse – edification
* Ord – the Word

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Vineyard, living stones, temple, witness retained verbatim.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warning contrasted with constructive ecclesial vision.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Parallelisms retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But when congregations now form the fellowship, then it must first and foremost be grounded in unity of faith and confession, and thereafter there must be certain ecclesial aims which are sought through the union. Without a common ground upon which to stand, no church fellowship can be built, and without common aims it can have no permanence.

The common ground which is to unite us as Lutheran congregations is the Lutheran Confession; the common goal toward which we must strive is the congregation’s own edification and the spread of the Word unto the end of the world. These two tasks alone are those which God’s Word sets before the congregation, and the fellowship cannot aim at anything else; otherwise there will continually arise a misdirected labor, a false goal, and a false and destructive striving.

Yet one principal question must still be pointed out before we proceed further, namely this question: Who shall form such a fellowship? It is so deeply ingrained and firmly rooted a prejudice among many Northerners, that it is only the pastors who are workers in the Lord’s vineyard, and that the “laity” are but a dead mass, that to many it seems altogether natural that, just as the pastors are to carry out all other labor in the congregation, so it is also they who are to form the fellowship, they who are to constitute the church body. If this superstition is to be removed, then one must begin at the root; it must be preached again and again that every Christian is a priest, that every Christian is called to be a worker, that no one is a Christian unless he takes the most living part in the work of edifying the congregation, according as God grants him the gift of the Spirit and the measure of faith. If it were first to be rightly and vividly acknowledged, by the light of God’s Spirit, that every member of the congregation is called to perform a service for the Lord, that every member of the congregation individually ought to be a living stone in the Lord’s temple, that every single Christian is a witness of the Lord upon the earth, then it would soon also be acknowledged that it is the congregations which are to form the fellowship, if the fellowship is to be an evangelical fellowship, and not a catholic dominion of priests.

Only there where the congregations truly awaken and form fellowship—only there will there arise a true church body; only there will there be the right goal, only there the right labor; only there will there be that breadth and weight in the work which God’s Word itself describes; only there can there, in the long run, be question of striving unceasingly toward this goal: the coming of God’s kingdom in us and around us. Therefore it is also only there, where the congregations truly form fellowship, that there will be the right permanence and firmness in the fellowship.
