STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Kirken,” “Menigheden,” “Kirkesamfundet” – technical ecclesiological terms whose relations must be preserved without anachronistic meanings.
* “Forfatning,” “Konstitution” – not modern constitutions but outward legal-organizational structures.
* “Magt og Myndighed” – authority and power in a theological, not merely institutional, sense.
* “Drift” – inward impulse or compulsion, especially of love, not external pressure.
* “Vidne” – witness in a confessional, spiritual sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, layered sentences with qualifications and logical pivots.
* Use of contrasts introduced by “derimod,” “thi,” “saa,” which must be preserved.
* Sermonic rhythm that should not be reduced to short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Apostolic authority grounded in the Word, not office.
* Unity of Church defined spiritually (Word, Sacraments, Spirit), not juridically.
* Rejection of hierarchical church structures as divinely instituted.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet restrained tone aimed at educated readers.
* Earnest insistence on doctrinal clarity without rhetorical excess.
* Confidence that assumes biblical literacy in the reader.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “bar dem paa sit Hjerte” – biblical idiom (cf. 2 Cor. 7:3); means deep pastoral concern.
* “Herrens Ord” – direct biblical register; best rendered as “the Word of the Lord.”
* “Aandens og Ordets Magt” – echoes Reformation theology; KJV-style cadence needed.
* “Huusholdere over Guds Gaver” – steward imagery (1 Cor. 4:1).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: No outward, centralized church organization existed in apostolic times.
* Evidence: Absence of pope, synods, constitutions; NT pattern of local congregations.
* Clarification: Apostolic care exercised through love, not jurisdiction.
* Doctrinal claim: Apostolic authority rests solely in the truth-power of God’s Word.
* Conclusion: Church is not higher than the congregation but a fellowship of congregations.
* Qualification: This does not imply that later outward organization is sinful or harmful.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Apostles as founders and shepherds – Acts, Pauline epistles.
* Protection from deception – Galatians, Corinthians, pastoral epistles.
* Word’s inherent power – Hebrews 4:12; Romans 1:16.
* Stewards of God’s gifts – 1 Corinthians 4:1.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firm rejection of hierarchical claims.
* Preserve confidence in Scripture over tradition.
* Avoid softening polemical edges.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa,” “kan kun,” “vilde være ganske urigtigt” rendered with full necessity and prohibition.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke – Church
* Menighed – congregation
* Magt – power
* Myndighed – authority
* Ord – Word
* Aand – Spirit

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Pastoral imagery (bearing on the heart, guarding souls).
* Household/stewardship metaphor.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemical denial → constructive clarification → pastoral caution.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and balanced clauses suitable for oral theological discourse.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

If, on the other hand, by “the Church” one understands an outward organization of several congregations under a common external constitution, then it must be frankly and openly admitted that we find no such thing in apostolic times. There is no pope, no presiding chairman, no synods or annual assemblies. There is no confession, no constitution; in short, there is absolutely no organized church body existing outside of or above the congregation. The congregation is the only organization that exists.

When, in very recent times, a high-church periodical in Norway has begun to speak of a “common governing body” in Jerusalem, which was said to possess power and authority over all the first Christian congregations, this is so utterly unprovable a claim that it would be an insult to our readers were we to begin demonstrating that no such governing body ever existed. Anyone who has read his New Testament knows how matters stood. The apostles traveled about and preached and founded congregations, and these congregations ordered themselves in approximately the same manner everywhere, with their presbyters and deacons. And the apostle who was their founder bore them upon his heart; and if he saw any danger drawing near to the newborn ones, he was immediately among them, either with speech or with letter, in order to guard the Word of the Lord and preserve the souls from deception. But there is no sign that anything other than the pure and free impulse of love moved him to speak, or the congregation to listen.

The apostolic office confers no power or authority beyond that which lies in the truth-power of God’s Word itself. That power Paul has; that power Peter has; that power every—even the least—believing witness upon earth has, and as stewards of God’s gifts they are to be esteemed. But no constitution or form of government has given them that power, nor can any human law take it from them. No other power or honor or right or freedom did the apostles ever demand or ever possess. Where the power of the Spirit and of the Word is great and living, as it was in the apostles, there it is both superfluous and wrong to add anything to it or take anything from it by means of human arrangements and constitutions.

The apostolic Church, then, is the congregations scattered throughout the Roman Empire, bound together not by an outward constitution, but by the unity of the Word and of faith, of the sacraments and of the Spirit. From this the definite conclusion may be drawn that the Church is not an order higher than the congregation, that it is not an authority set over the congregation, that it is not a society of a higher kind than the congregation; for if it were so, it would have had to exist from the very beginning. Later church history cannot add anything new of a higher kind than what already existed; it can only develop and unfold, gather together and unite, what was already present from the beginning. The church body can only be the fellowship of congregations; Church and congregation are of the same kind, and the difference is only this, that by the Church we understand a union of several congregations.

On the other hand, it would be quite wrong if anyone were to suppose that, since the apostolic congregations did not form any outward society united by definite societal laws, it is therefore a superfluous—and therefore a harmful—thing for congregations to unite with one another in such an outward manner.
