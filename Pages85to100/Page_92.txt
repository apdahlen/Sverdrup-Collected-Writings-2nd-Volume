STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Samfund" (19th-c. sense): not merely "society" but ecclesial association/communion; must avoid modern sociological dilution.
* "Menighed" vs. "Kirke": congregation vs. church; careful distinction.
* "fri Kirke" / "frie Menigheder": free from the State, not free-form or doctrinally lax.
* "Myndighed": authority/jurisdiction, not competence.
* "Undertrykker": oppressor in an ecclesial-historical sense.
* "sendrægtige": slow, deliberate; not negligent.
* "Opbyggelse": edification with Pauline resonance.
* "Grundvold": foundation; biblical metaphor (Eph. 2:20).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with concessive pivots ("men", "thi", "paa den anden Side").
* Semicolon logic that carries theological contrast.
* Accumulative argumentation that must not be fragmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Nature of the Church vs. congregations.
* Authority vs. voluntary association.
* Role of Word and Spirit as ruling principles.
* Historical warnings against ecclesial domination.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, cautionary Lutheran tone.
* Exhortational address to communal conscience.
* Avoid smoothing into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "staar som vældige Skræmsler": stands as mighty terrors/warnings—rhetorical, not emotional exaggeration.
* "dyrkjøbte Lærdom": dearly bought lesson—experiential, historical cost.
* "ved Guds Naade": standard theological idiom; retain explicitly.
* "Forening giver Kraft": proverbial but ecclesially applied.
* "paa den ganske Jord": biblical universality (cf. Matt. 28).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Historical problem: Church history as warning against forming societies.
* Clarification: Congregations must form societies by nature.
* Distinction: Society is not new authority but voluntary union.
* Moral claim: If union gives strength, it is duty.
* Critical question: How strength serves congregations, not dominates them.
* Condition: Only Word and Spirit prevent harm.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 2:20 – "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets".
* Great Commission – "over the whole earth".
* Word and Spirit ruling – Reformation ecclesiology.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warnings drawn from history.
* Maintain earnest joy and cautious hope.
* Preserve moral urgency without embellishment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" → must.
* "kan" with negation → cannot.
* Moral necessity retained as obligation, not suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Samfund → society / association (consistently ecclesial).
* Menighed → congregation.
* Kirke → Church.
* Opbyggelse → edification.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Foundation imagery preserved.
* Strength as power retained, not abstracted.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning vs. gratitude for history.
* Duty vs. danger.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Semicolons retained to mirror sermonic pacing.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The misfortune, however, is this: that the history both of the Papal Church and of the State Church stands before us as mighty terrors whenever the question is raised of forming a society; nor is the history of the Norwegian Synod a less frightening example for the formation of societies within the free Church. For although the Norwegian Synod is small and its history short in comparison with the two aforementioned forms of church, it is for that very reason so much nearer to us, and it furnishes the striking proof that a free Church (that is, independent of the State) and free congregations do not always go hand in hand. No wonder, therefore, if the long history which shows us “the Church,” whether Papal or State Church, as the oppressor of the congregation, still works with a paralyzing effect upon the development of a free church society. Yet on the other hand we must rejoice deeply that we have this history to look back upon, and are therefore exceedingly cautious and willingly somewhat slow in our development; for the dearly bought lesson that lies therein shall, by the grace of God, become for us a strong guidance in our future work.

We may gather the result of our consideration into these two propositions: that the Christian congregations, by their very nature, must form societies and therefore always have formed societies; but that, on the other hand, the society of congregations, or the Church, is not a new authority over the congregation, but the voluntary union of congregations for mutual help and strengthening.

It is a thing known to us all, that union gives strength; and there is surely no one who does not perceive that if the Church of God on earth can attain greater strength through the union of congregations, then it is not only their right, but also their duty, to form a society.

But the question is how this increased strength may accrue to the congregation and to no other; how the union may become such that it truly works toward the same goal which is the congregation’s own, namely, the edification of the congregation upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and the spreading of the Kingdom of God over the whole earth; for upon these two things all congregational labor turns, and if the society does not serve this end, then it has no significance for the congregation.

Yet we add at once, that the strength which is strong enough to do good is always also mighty enough to do harm. If therefore the society is to be of benefit, then precisely the same thing is required in the society as in the individual congregation: the Word of the Lord and the Spirit of the Lord must be leading and reigning in all things; otherwise all becomes harm instead of benefit.
