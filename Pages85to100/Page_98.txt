STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" carries ecclesial-theological weight (congregation as spiritual body), not merely "community".
* "Opbyggelse" implies edification/building up in Pauline sense, not moral encouragement.
* "Uniform" is metaphorical, ecclesial conformity rather than literal dress.
* "Mønstre Hæren" echoes biblical-military imagery of divine inspection.
* "Naademidler" (means of grace) is a technical Lutheran term.
* "Stiftelse" here means establishment/dwelling, not institution.
* "Forunderlige Kraft" risks dilution if rendered weakly.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered clauses and rhetorical pivots.
* Parallel constructions (either/or, not…but).
* Sermonic cadence dependent on semicolons and cumulative force.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between outward form and inward seal of God.
* Doctrine of Word and Sacrament as sole means of true church growth.
* Faith as fruit of means of grace and bond with Christ.
* Purification and sanctification occurring simultaneously.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical earnestness against human-devised church-building.
* Exhortational warning against false unity.
* Consolatory yet sober depiction of the Church’s pilgrim state.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Herren kjender sine" – direct biblical quotation (cf. 2 Tim. 2:19), KJV: "The Lord knoweth them that are his."
* Military imagery (uniform, army, muster) reflects Pauline metaphors (Eph. 6).
* "Vandre forsmæret og slagen" – idiom for despised and afflicted pilgrimage.
* "Aandens Frihed" – Pauline phrase (2 Cor. 3:17).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Negative thesis: Church edification does not consist in outward uniformity.
* Illustration: Uniforms produce only humanly impressive order.
* Divine judgment: God recognizes only inward seal, not external conformity.
* Generalization: Applies equally to doctrinal formulas or moral habits.
* Positive thesis: True edification is the work of Word and Spirit alone.
* Means: Word and Sacraments as exclusive instruments.
* Result: Faith unites to Christ, renews God’s image, forms new people.
* Consequence: Ongoing purification and sanctification.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Timothy 2:19 – "The Lord knoweth them that are his."
* Ephesians 4:15–16 – growth up into the Head, Christ.
* 1 Corinthians 3 – God’s temple imagery.
* Romans 8 – freedom of the Spirit, children of God.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain polemical edge against human church-building schemes.
* Preserve gravity in divine inspection imagery.
* Retain earnest insistence on purity of means of grace.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan" / "kan derfor ikke" rendered as strong impossibility.
* "maa" rendered as moral and theological necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Congregation
* Opbyggelse = Edification / building up
* Ord = Word
* Aand = Spirit
* Naademidler = Means of grace

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Uniform/army imagery retained.
* Temple and growth metaphors preserved.
* Purification and sanctification kept distinct yet simultaneous.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning against false unity.
* Positive, hope-filled description of true growth.
* Solemn but liberating conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.
* Semicolons used to maintain sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Neither does the edification of the Congregation consist in this, that the Congregation puts on a uniform, so that the congregations become like small troops in an army. If this uniform becomes nothing more than an outward garment, which otherwise has nothing to do with the man himself, then it may indeed serve to produce a well-ordered party that presents a fair appearance before men; but when the Lord comes to muster the army, there may perhaps be none whom He knows; for His mark is not the outward, but the inward, the holy seal upon God’s Congregation: “The Lord knoweth them that are his.” It is precisely the same whether the uniform is a particular form of doctrine or a particular form of life; whether it consists in a lesson that is learned by rote, or in a habit that is practiced. All such “edifications” of the Church and the Congregation we ought rather to combat.

The edification and growth of the Congregation is the work of the Word and of the Spirit; it therefore cannot be promoted, but is hindered, by all human thought and all human work that does not have its ground in the Word and is not driven by the Spirit.

The edification of the Congregation into God’s temple, and its growth up unto the Head, is first and foremost wrought by God’s Word and His Sacraments, and by nothing else. Therefore it must be the highest striving of the Congregation and of the fellowship to preserve these pure and unadulterated. Faith is the proper fruit of the means of grace, and it is that wondrous power which separates the Congregation from the world and binds it to God. Through it Christ becomes ours, and the image of God is renewed within the heart. Christ takes up His dwelling in us, and the Congregation becomes the new race of God’s children, which indeed walks despised and smitten, yet also liberated and saved through a world held in bondage. This, then, is what we mean by the edification of the Congregation: its renewal through faith and its holy union with Christ, its growth in purity and virtues, its increase in freedom and life.

In this growth there takes place, through the power of the Word and of faith, both a continual purification and a continual sanctification. The Congregation is cleansed from sin, and indeed also separates from itself those who once clung to the Congregation, but more and more closed their hearts to the Lord’s Word. The Congregation is sanctified, in that it is ever more deeply immersed in the Word and penetrates into its depths, is permeated by the life of God, united ever more inwardly with Christ, and more and more presents itself as the race of God’s children, where there is the freedom of the Spirit and the love of the Spirit poured forth.
