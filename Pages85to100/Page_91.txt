STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kirkelig Tanke" — carries ecclesiological weight; not merely "religious thought" but church-constituted reasoning.
* "Menighed" — congregation as a theological body, not generic "people." Must remain consistent.
* "Pavevælde / Kongevælde" — systems of rule; avoid modern political flattening.
* "Hævdelse" — assertion/maintenance with juridical force.
* "Blusel" — moral shame, not mere embarrassment.
* "Trældom" — bondage/slavery with strong biblical resonance.
* "Godtthie" — arbitrary will; tyrannical discretion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long comparative sentences contrasting papal and royal power.
* Parenthetical concessions that must remain intact.
* Rhetorical pivots marked by semicolons.
* Sermonic cadence that resists fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as the communion of saints.
* Right administration of Word and Sacraments.
* Congregational freedom versus hierarchical domination.
* Protestant doctrine as a moral and spiritual counterweight to abuse.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical yet penitential Lutheran tone.
* Address to collective conscience.
* Moral shame juxtaposed with doctrinal pride.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "slaa vore Øine til Jorden" — biblical idiom of shame and repentance (cf. Ezra 9:6).
* "give ... synderlig efter" — not yield much; must preserve ironic bite.
* "raader" — prevailing, ruling opinion; not mere popularity.
* "Samfund af Menigheder" — technical ecclesiological formula.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Initial concession: Protestants lack grounds for boasting over Catholics.
* Comparative argument: Papal election vs. royal appointment.
* Clarification: Lesser abuse by kings is contingent, not principled.
* Doctrinal explanation: Protestant teaching restrains tyranny.
* Historical example: Treatment of Hauge in Norway.
* Conclusion of section: Improvement due to the people, not the king.
* Second movement: Critique of prevailing ecclesiology among theologians.
* Final assertion: Church is congregation; unions must preserve freedom.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "the communion of saints" — Apostles’ Creed.
* "where the Gospel is rightly preached and the Sacraments rightly administered" — Augsburg Confession VII.
* Imagery of bondage/freedom — Pauline resonance (Galatians).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp critique without sarcasm.
* Preserve moral shame and urgency.
* Do not soften accusations of tyranny or ignorance.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" — must.
* "kan" — cannot (retain impossibility where stated).
* "skulde" — normative obligation, not hypothetical.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke — Church.
* Menighed — congregation.
* Frihed — freedom/liberty.
* Ret — right.
* Samfund — fellowship/communion.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Bondage vs. freedom imagery retained.
* Shame imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Pride in doctrine contrasted with shame in practice.
* Severity toward hierarchy balanced with hope in popular reform.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorical force depends on accumulation.
* Semicolons preserved to mark argumentative turns.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

We therefore have little ground for boasting in this respect over against the Catholics. For if wrong there must be, there is nevertheless more ecclesiastical thought in having a pope chosen by the men of the Church to govern the Church, than in having a king who often has no greater interest in the Church than a thirst to occupy such a place. It is another matter that kings perhaps have not always mishandled the congregation as much as the popes; this does not arise from the fact that royal dominion is more justified within the Church than papal dominion, but from the fact that in the Protestant lands it does not go over so well to treat the people in the same manner as there where Catholicism has made them into an ignorant mass, and the Lutheran doctrine has within itself a counterweight against excessive abuses. But otherwise the royal power has even fairly frequently treated the congregation in a manner which by no means yields the papal power any notable advantage. In the midst of our enthusiasm for the Lutheran Church’s clear assertion of God’s truth, we must cast our eyes to the ground with shame when we consider how matters stand with the freedom and right of the congregation in the Lutheran lands. In Norway we have a fairly striking example thereof in the treatment that was meted out to Hauge. If since that time things have become better in our fatherland, this is due not to the king but to the people.

The notion that “the Church” stands over the congregation, and that it may command the congregation according to its own arbitrary will, is to this day the prevailing one among most Norwegian theologians; and it will no doubt take a good deal of time before it becomes a fully settled matter, no longer open to dispute, that the Church is the communion of saints, in which the Gospel is rightly preached and the Sacraments rightly administered, or that the Church is the congregation, and that therefore the congregations’ union into what we call a church body always is and remains a fellowship of congregations. No higher fellowship comes into being thereby when the congregations unite, such that the congregations should thus be led into bondage; rather, by forming a fellowship the congregations should unite their powers in order thereby to advance their interests, preserve their freedom, and guard their right.
