STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" (congregation/church body) carries ecclesiological weight; must not be flattened to "church" in an institutional sense.
* "Forbindelse" and "Sammenslutning" imply organic connection, not merely administrative union.
* "Trang" denotes inward necessity or felt need, not mere convenience.
* "Udviklingen" here implies providential historical maturation, not modern evolutionary progress.
* "Tid" often functions theologically as God-ordained season.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered causal clauses must be preserved.
* Parenthetical explanations and em-dash pivots structure the argument rhetorically.
* Enumeration ("for det første … for det andet") must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Apostolic authority vs. congregational deliberation.
* Spiritual ("aandelige") vs. temporal ("timelige") aid must remain distinct.
* The role of the Mosaic Law in early Christianity.
* The concept of the Church as one body with many local congregations.

Voice Hazards:

* Explanatory but reverent historical-theological tone.
* Avoid modern academic neutrality; preserve earnest ecclesial reflection.
* Do not reduce solemn cadence to neutral historiography.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "moden Frugt af Udviklingen" – metaphor of organic growth; cf. biblical fruit imagery (Gal. 5).
* "selve den gamle Pagts Centrum" – Jerusalem as theological center of the Old Covenant.
* "Søstermenigheden" – familial ecclesial idiom; must be preserved as "sister congregation."
* "Bindeled" – organic connective metaphor.
* Biblical references (Acts 15; 1 Cor. 16; 2 Cor. 8–9) function as authoritative exempla.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Inter-congregational connection was both desirable and necessary already in apostolic times.
* Proof by historical examples (Jerusalem Council; Pauline collection).
* Theological inference: mutual spiritual and temporal need.
* Explanation of why formal federation did not yet arise.
* Practical-historical constraints (workload, communication, persecution).

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 15 – Jerusalem Council.
* Pauline collections – 1 Corinthians 16; 2 Corinthians 8–9.
* Implicit body imagery of the Church (cf. 1 Cor. 12).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain seriousness and reflective gravity.
* Avoid casual historical narration.
* Preserve sense of necessity and providence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" → "must" / "had to."
* "vilde" in hypothetical reasoning must retain deliberative force.
* "kunde" expressing real hindrance, not mere possibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation.
* Apostler = apostles.
* Aandelige / timelige = spiritual / temporal.
* Forbindelse = connection / bond.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fruit, bond, center, hindrance metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Confidence in apostolic precedent vs. realism about historical limits.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long periodic sentences.
* Maintain explanatory rhythm suitable for public reading.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

We find, already before the apostolic congregations, clear signs that a connection between the congregations was both desirable and necessary, and that it therefore had to come forth, in its own time, as a mature fruit of development. We shall here mention only a couple of examples, so as not to become overly prolix.

The first remarkable feature is the deputation sent from the congregation in Antioch to the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem, of which we read in Acts, chapter 15. It was the very great question of the relation of the Gentile Christians to the Mosaic Law that was at stake at that time. The congregation in Antioch was divided and of differing mind in this important matter, and it found that it would gain greater certainty if it could hear the counsel of others. Above all, it desired to hear from Jerusalem how one there, in the very center of the old covenant, thought concerning the ceremonies of the old covenant. A congregational meeting was held in Jerusalem, and after much disputation some of the apostles took the floor, and their judgment became the prevailing one and was adopted by the congregation; wherefore the congregation also sent men with word of this decision to the sister congregation in Antioch.

Another example of how the congregations were in need of one another’s support and help we have in the collection of money which, under the leadership of Paul, was undertaken in the congregations for the relief of the brethren in Judea. We find it mentioned in 1 Corinthians 16 and 2 Corinthians 8–9. From these two examples, which are the most prominent and best known, we see that already in apostolic times there was within the congregations a need for mutual assistance, both in spiritual and in temporal matters. The apostles themselves had, in this period, to serve as a bond between the individual congregations and to knit them together.

If it did not immediately come to an outward and formal union, this was because there were so many both inward and outward reasons which made such a constitutional association impossible. For in the first place each congregation had so exceedingly much work with its own affairs that time would not suffice for much more; and in the second place we must remember that communication between the various parts of the world was not nearly so easy in that time as it is now. For a congregation in Jerusalem to get word to a congregation in Rome would, in the most favorable case, take as much time as it would take for word to go from here to Norway, not to mention that persecution could hinder it altogether; and such circumstances must naturally have contributed greatly to the fact that it neither went easily nor quickly to establish a lasting connection between the congregations among themselves.
