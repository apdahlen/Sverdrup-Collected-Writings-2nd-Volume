STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kirkesamfund" – not merely a social association, but a confessional ecclesial body.
* "Grund" – doctrinal foundation, not institutional origin.
* "Maal" – teleological goal, eschatological and pastoral, not pragmatic objective.
* "Opbyggelse" – edification/building-up in Pauline sense, not organizational growth.
* "udvortes" – outward/external, often polemically contrasted with inward/spiritual.
* "Stifte" – ordinances or statutes imposed externally.
* "Væxt" – organic growth, biblically charged.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with multiple subordinate clauses.
* Semicolon-driven logic reflecting sermon cadence.
* Parallel constructions contrasting true vs false edification.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as living temple of God.
* Contrast between spiritual life and mere external order.
* Polemic against hierarchical self-exaltation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone warning against corruption.
* Irony and restrained polemic must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Menighedens Opbyggelse til et levende Tempel" – Pauline imagery (1 Cor. 3; Eph. 2).
* "Væxt opad til sit Hoved, Kristus" – direct echo of Eph. 4:15.
* "de siger det vel, men gjør det ikke" – Matt. 23:3 resonance.
* Tower imagery – Gen. 11 (Tower of Babel), human pride.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Necessity of clarity regarding both foundation and goal.
* Assertion of the true goal: edification of the congregation and spread of God’s kingdom.
* Recognition of false agreement in name but not in deed.
* Clarification of what true edification is not.
* Polemic against external order and hierarchical exaltation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Living temple – Eph. 2:21–22.
* Growth unto the Head – Eph. 4:15.
* Saying and not doing – Matt. 23:3.
* Tower reaching heaven – Gen. 11:4.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warnings against corrupt directions.
* Preserve irony in describing false “edification.”

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan" / "kun" rendered with necessity and exclusivity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Opbyggelse = edification.
* Menighed = congregation.
* Væxt = growth.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Building, temple, tower metaphors retained without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Didactic clarity contrasted with sharp polemic.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Just as important as it is to be fully clear concerning the foundation of the ecclesial fellowship, so that it is made neither too broad nor too narrow, so equally urgent is it to be fully clear concerning the goal that is set before us; for only thereby can we be preserved from corrupting directions and from the most painful experiences. And only when we have the right goal can we also, with clarity, choose the right means. That goal for which we labor together must likewise determine what is to be a matter of the society and what is to be a matter of the congregation.

We have said that the goal is the congregation’s own edification and the spread of the kingdom of God over the whole earth. We cannot adopt any lesser or any narrower goal.

It is evident that all societies will claim that they pursue this goal; and if they truly did so, then all churchly conflict would rest either upon mere misunderstandings or upon disagreement over trifles and useless questions. But alas, we often find even of ecclesial bodies that “they say it well, but do it not.” It therefore becomes necessary more closely to explain what we mean when we say that the goal is the edification of the congregation into a living temple for the Lord, or the growth of the congregation upward unto its Head, Christ.

It is not our meaning that the edification of the congregation into God’s temple consists in an outward constitution, whereby the Church is transformed into a well-ordered assembly of people who bow to certain outward church laws, and by a determined external order set each one in his place from the highest to the lowest. For with all such outward order one may indeed set a splendid building in place; but it lacks—everything; for it lacks life. God does not dwell therein. It is then not the Spirit of God who joins the whole together, but outward commands and ordinances.

Nor does the edification of the congregation consist in this, that it establishes higher and higher dignities in its midst, beginning with priests who constitute a higher kind of people than “the laity,” then setting bishops over the priests, archbishops over the bishops, and finally a pope over the whole. This too is an “edification,” indeed a sheer “piling up,” until it becomes “a tower whose top reaches unto heaven”; but it would be quite peculiar to call this “the edification of the congregation.” It is indeed growth upward, but not unto Christ; it is self-exaltation.
