STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Opbyggelse" (edification/building-up) carries ecclesial and spiritual nuance beyond mere instruction.
* "Menighed" denotes the gathered people of God, not merely an institution.
* "Aanden" must be read theologically (the Spirit) rather than psychologically.
* "Paulun" (tabernacle) bears biblical resonance (Exod. imagery; Rev. 21).
* "Forkrænkelighed" signifies corruption/mortality (1 Cor. 15), not simple weakness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with parallel clauses and sermonic cadence.
* Semicolon logic that must be preserved to maintain rhetorical force.
* Accumulative metaphors (house, city, army) that function in sequence.

Theological Hazards:

* Eschatological orientation (goal beyond death and grave).
* Doctrine of the Church as God’s dwelling by the Spirit.
* Tension between present striving and future consummation.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational tone addressing conscience (“vil du sige”).
* Warning against lowering the Church’s aim.
* Elevated, confessional Lutheran gravity that resists modernization.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Guds Bolig i Aanden" echoes Eph. 2:22 ("an habitation of God through the Spirit").
* "fatte sit Anker indenfor Forhænget" alludes to Heb. 6:19–20.
* "fra Hav til Hav, fra Pol til Pol" functions as a meristic idiom for totality.
* Bridal imagery and the New Jerusalem derive from Rev. 21.
  KJV diction offers natural equivalents for these biblical idioms.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Inner spiritual edification precedes and governs outer form.
* Expansion: The Church depicted as house, city, and host—ordered and peaceful.
* Objection addressed: The goal seems unattainable in mortal life.
* Resolution: The Church’s strength lies in a goal beyond death.
* Warning: A lowered goal leads to ruin with the world.
* Eschatological confirmation: Fulfillment at the descent of the New Jerusalem.
* Missional conclusion: The same goal compels outward proclamation to all nations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Eph. 2:21–22 – God’s dwelling in the Spirit.
* Ps. 48 / Rev. 21 – City of God imagery.
* Heb. 6:19 – Anchor within the veil.
* Rev. 21:2–3 – New Jerusalem, tabernacle among men.
* Matt. 24:14 – Gospel preached to all nations.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No softening of warnings regarding worldly aims.
* Maintain earnest exhortation and eschatological urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in "maa være den første," "kan vi heller ikke stanse."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Opbyggelse" consistently rendered as "edification."
* "Menighed" as "the Church" or "the congregation" in ecclesial sense.
* "Aand" as "the Spirit."

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Retain architectural, civic, military, nautical, and bridal metaphors intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Preserve shifts from calm description to warning to triumphant hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences and balanced clauses suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

To this inward edification the outward answers. Thus the congregation becomes the dwelling of God in the Spirit, the city of God, which is perfectly fair, perfectly ordered, where there is no disturbance. God’s house is the home of order, where each knows his place; God’s city is the fortress of peace, where all things have their proper rule; God’s people are a host of warriors, where each hero stands at his post and on his watch. Yet the chief matter is always this: that the inward edification in Spirit and faith of God’s people must be the first, and the outward form must follow therefrom.

Ah yes, you will say, but this goal we never attain in the land of corruption. Yes, that is true; it is heavy. Yet herein also lie the power and the victory, that we have a calling, a goal, a crown that is lifted high above corruption and grave and death. Herein lies the strength of the Church and of the fellowship, that it boldly lays hold of its anchor within the veil. There first is the harbor, there is the rest, there is the crown. If the goal be not so high, it is not fit for God’s Church. She must lift her gaze so far and so high that it reaches beyond all the greatness of the earth and all the falsehood of the world. If she takes to herself a lower goal, then she perishes with the world, then she is lost with the world, then she falls with the goal which she pursues here below. The Church strives toward the goal of becoming God’s people; but John says that this goal is reached only then, when the new Jerusalem descends from heaven as a bride adorned for her bridegroom; then shall the tabernacle of God be among the children of men, and he shall be our God, and we shall be his people.

If the Church has set the right goal for her own edification, then thereby she has also the right goal for her work outward. If we cannot rest until we reach the heavenly Jerusalem, and only then deem the Church’s task here fulfilled, when God dwells in his people in everlasting glory, then neither can we halt until the gospel of the kingdom has been preached to all nations. Further and further onward, farther and farther out must the message of salvation press, until the testimony of the crucified fills the earth, until it sounds from sea to sea, from pole to pole.
