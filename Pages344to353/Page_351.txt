STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Afsøden" (older form of "afsiden/afsondren/afsondelse"): here meaning absolute severance or complete separation; must not be weakened to mere "withdrawal".
* "Delagtiggjørelse": participatory sharing, not mere reception; carries Pauline participation theology.
* "Kjødet": Pauline "flesh" (sarx), not simply the physical body.
* "Menigheden": congregation/Church as living body; not a mere institution.
* "Løsen": watchword, rallying cry, guiding principle.
* "nødes": compel/urge strongly (Luke 14), not gentle invitation.
* "Legeme", "Lemmer": body/members with 1 Corinthians 12 resonance.
* "Rørelse": movement, activity, stirring—avoid emotionalism.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal chains ("Derfor … derfor …").
* Biblical quotation embedded mid-paragraph.
* Lists built by rhythmic repetition ("Rum for …").
* Argument flows by theological inference, not narrative.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of sanctification as incomplete in this life.
* Participation in the risen life of Christ (already/not yet).
* Law/Gospel tension in Romans 7.
* Means of grace (Word and Sacrament).
* Priesthood of all believers.
* Work of the Holy Spirit as ordering freedom, not chaos.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Pastoral urgency without sentimental softening.
* Corporate address to conscience of the Church.
* Rhythm suited for proclamation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Saa tjener jeg da Guds Lov med Sindet, men Syndens Lov med Kjødet": direct echo of Romans 7:25; KJV diction preferred.
* "Paa Veien og ved Gjærderne": Luke 14:23 ("highways and hedges").
* "forlorne Sønner og Døtre": Luke 15; "prodigal" language.
* "Vingaarden": Matthew 20; labor imagery.
* "Arbeidere": not mere volunteers but divinely appointed workers.
* "Rum for Kamp og Rum for Seier": militant church imagery; avoid abstraction.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Absolute separation from flesh/world is absent; therefore perfect participation in resurrection life is absent.
* Pauline illustration: Romans 7 as paradigmatic for believers.
* Inference: Continuous room for growth in the Church.
* Missional expansion: inward growth and outward gathering.
* Metaphor shift: Church as body needing nourishment and organs.
* Provision: God supplies both through means of grace and members.
* Correction of error: Church is not a one-organ body (the pastor alone).
* Conclusion: True freedom and activity ordered by the Holy Spirit.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Romans 7:25 – service of law in mind vs flesh.
* Luke 14:23 – compel them to come in.
* Luke 15 – prodigal sons and daughters.
* 1 Corinthians 12 – body and members.
* Matthew 28 – implicit missionary mandate.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings about incompleteness of sanctification retained.
* Urgency of mission preserved.
* No softening of struggle imagery.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal", "kræves": rendered as "must," "is required."
* Divine provision stated as fact, not suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Church/congregation (used consistently).
* Kjødet = the flesh.
* Aand = Spirit.
* Ord og Sakrament = Word and Sacrament.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body/organ imagery retained.
* Growth and nourishment imagery preserved.
* Vineyard labor imagery maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Struggle vs hope.
* Rest vs labor.
* Freedom vs fear.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Parallel repetitions maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There is in no one an absolute and complete severance from the world and the flesh. Therefore there is also in no one a full and perfect participation in the life of the Risen One. With believers in all ages it fares as it did with Paul, who says: “So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.”

Therefore at all times there is room for growth in the Church. Ever onward is the watchword of Christians and of the Christian Church, until the coming of Christ.

And in outward regard there is always, both at home within Christendom and beyond its borders, a great multitude of souls who may be gathered into the Church through the Gospel. Along the highways and by the hedges there are many lost and wretched people, many prodigal sons and daughters, who ought to be compelled to come in. And think, think of the millions of heathen who have not heard and do not hear the blessed Gospel of Christ! There is room for growth, room for advance, room for struggle, and room for victory.

But if a body is to grow, then two things in particular are required, namely nourishment and organs.

God has provided for both. The Church has received Word and Sacrament. Through these it receives nourishment and vital strength; power of resistance against the world and sin and death, so that in spite of all the contagion of corruption it may nevertheless keep itself living and sound; strength for labor, so that it need not sink powerless beneath the toil and burden of the mighty work.

The Church is also equipped with many members, all of which are organs through which the Church receives Spirit and carries out its work. The misunderstanding that the Church has only a single organ, namely the pastor, stands in opposition both to the letter of Scripture and to its spirit. All Christians, men and women, adults and children, are called and appointed and gifted to be workers in the vineyard. There is rest and peace in God’s Church; there is also busyness and life and activity. There is nothing but movement and freedom in the Church. Many are fearful of such freedom in the Church; but this is because they do not know the working and power of the Holy Spirit; for God’s Spirit is mighty, through God’s Word, to give to each member its own work.
