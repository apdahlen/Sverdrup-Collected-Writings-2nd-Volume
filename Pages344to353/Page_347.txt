STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden – not merely "congregation" but the Church as a living, spiritual body.
* Helligaand – the Holy Ghost / Holy Spirit with full Trinitarian weight.
* Gjerning – divine act or work, not generic action.
* Raad / Husholdningen i Tidernes Fylde – Pauline salvation-historical terminology (Eph. 1:10).
* Salighed – blessedness/salvation, eschatological felicity.
* Uforgængelighed – incorruption/immortality.
* Forsoning – atonement in a sacrificial, objective sense.
* Delagtig – participatory sharing, not mere association.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended hypotactic sentences with cumulative clauses.
* Repetitive infinitive constructions ("det gjaldt om at …").
* Sermonic parallelism and rhythmic escalation.
* Semicolon logic that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Strong doctrines of sin, wrath, death, atonement, resurrection.
* Objective work of Christ versus subjective appropriation.
* Necessity of death-and-resurrection union with Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, elevated Lutheran sermonic tone.
* Direct doctrinal assertion without hedging.
* Biblical diction echoing Scripture.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Vinden blæser hvor den vil" – John 3:8; must follow KJV phrasing.
* "Husholdningen i Tidernes Fylde" – Eph. 1:10; KJV: "dispensation of the fulness of times."
* "Dødens bundne Slaver" – bondage imagery, Rom. 6; Heb. 2:15.
* "i Aand og Sandhed" – John 4:24.
* "Levendegjørelse" – vivification, regeneration.

Literal rendering risks flattening biblical resonance; KJV-aligned diction required.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church exists only through the sending of the Holy Spirit.
* Historical-theological grounding: sin, death, wrath disrupted creation.
* Divine counteraction: eternal counsel of grace to restore all.
* Christological necessity: atonement, resurrection, Spirit-union.
* Ecclesiological conclusion: Church as Christ’s body.
* Soteriological application: believer’s death and resurrection with Christ.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 3:8 (new birth by the Spirit).
* Ephesians 1:10 (dispensation of the fulness of times).
* Revelation 1:18 ("I am he that liveth, and was dead").
* Romans 6; Colossians 2–3 (death and resurrection with Christ).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and assertions concerning death, wrath, and necessity of atonement must remain unsoftened.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kunde der ingen Menighed fødes" – absolute impossibility.
* "Ingen er delagtig" – categorical exclusion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – Church
* Helligaand – Holy Ghost
* Liv – Life (capitalized where doctrinally weighty)
* Død – Death

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Birth imagery of the Church.
* Flowing life of Christ through the body.
* Death and resurrection participation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From cosmic tragedy (sin, death, wrath)
* To redemptive purpose (grace, restoration)
* To triumphant life (resurrection, eternal life)

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Sentence length and clause rhythm preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

For that the Church might come into being, Jesus went unto the Father, that from him he might send the Holy Ghost. The Spirit came, and the Church was born. The word spoken to Nicodemus received its fairest fulfilment: “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof; but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”

It is the holy work of the triune God that stands before us when we contemplate the wondrous coming-into-being of the Church. Sin had disturbed God’s work of creation; Death had become lord over the fallen creature; God’s wrath over sin laid loveless suffering upon the human being who was created for blessedness. God’s eternal counsel concerning the dispensation of the fulness of times was a counsel of love and of grace; for it was concerned with restoring all the damage which sin had wrought; it was concerned with abolishing the power of sin and of death and of condemnation over humankind; it was concerned with giving back to death’s bound slaves life and incorruption. Therefore no Church could be born, no fellowship of God’s liberated children be created, without atonement through Christ’s death, life from the dead through Christ’s resurrection, union with God and his Son through the Holy Ghost. God’s free and living people upon earth have as their nearest and indispensable presupposition the death and resurrection of the Son of God, and union with him through the Holy Ghost.

It is for this reason that the Church is Christ’s body; the ascended Saviour dwelleth, through the living faith wrought by the Spirit, in his believers. He was dead, and behold, he is alive for evermore. Thus must it also be said of every one who in spirit and in truth would belong to his body: This one was dead, and behold, he liveth. That life of Christ which pulses through the Church by the Holy Ghost is the life of the risen One; it is life after death, the eternal life which dieth no more. None is partaker thereof save he who himself is dead and raised up with him. The living faith is a death from the world upon Christ’s cross, and a being made alive unto God through Christ’s resurrection.
