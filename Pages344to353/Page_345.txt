STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheden" – must be rendered consistently as "the congregation" or "the Church," preserving ecclesial depth.
* "Husholdning" – Pauline term (οἰκονομία); not domestic but redemptive administration.
* "Tiderne’s Fylde" – biblical-eschatological phrase (Gal. 4:4; Eph. 1:10).
* "Hemmelighed" – must preserve Pauline "mystery," not mere secret.
* "velbehagelige Beslutning" – divine good pleasure / gracious decree.
* "levne" – to leave, spare, preserve a remnant.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered biblical quotation.
* Accumulative prophetic citations that must not be fragmented.
* Semicolon logic expressing theological progression.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of election and eternal counsel.
* Church as fulfillment of OT promise.
* Remnant theology, judgment and purification.
* Indwelling presence of God among His people.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn prophetic register.
* Exhortational, doxological tone.
* Danger of modernizing prophetic imagery.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Husholdning i Tidernes Fylde" – Eph. 1:10; KJV: "dispensation of the fulness of times."
* "Guds Bolig" – Rev. 21:3 resonance; dwelling/tabernacle.
* "Dugg fra Morgenrødens Skjød" – Psalm 110 imagery of divine generation and vitality.
* "Elendigt og ringe Folk" – Zeph. 3; humble remnant, not merely poor.
* Refining fire (silver/gold) – Malachi / Zechariah imagery of sanctification.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church was eternally prepared and foreordained by God.
* Support: Hidden in God’s eternal counsel, yet prophetically announced.
* Evidence: Continuous prophetic witness from Moses to Malachi.
* Development: Imagery of blessing, vitality, judgment, and purification.
* Conclusion: The refined remnant acknowledged as God’s people.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Eph. 1:9–10 – mystery and divine purpose.
* Amos 3:7 – prophetic revelation.
* Rev. 21:3 – God dwelling among His people.
* 2 Sam. 23:4 – David’s last words.
* Psalm 110:3 – Messianic kingship.
* Micah 5 – remnant among the nations.
* Zephaniah 3 – humble people and divine rejoicing.
* Zech. 13:7–9 – smitten shepherd and refined remnant.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain prophetic gravity.
* Preserve judgment and consolation without softening.
* Maintain solemn cadence and scriptural authority.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve divine necessity and certainty ("skal", "vil").
* Avoid weakening prophetic declarations.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – Church / Congregation.
* Forjættelse – Promise.
* Raad – Counsel.
* Folk – People.
* Gud i Midten – God in the midst.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Morning light, dew, rain, lion, fire, refining metals.
* Preserve imagery without explanatory dilution.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Promise vs. judgment.
* Consolation vs. purification.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences.
* Maintain proclamation rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But the Congregation is not without its preparation. This new “dispensation in the fulness of times,” this “mystery of Christ,” was hidden in God from the foundation of the world, and was the object of His eternal counsel, His “good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.”

Therefore it was also proclaimed and promised by the prophets throughout the whole Old Testament age; “for the Lord GOD doeth nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7). From Moses to Malachi the voice of promise sounds forth through all the prophets, concerning the day that is to come, when the dwelling of God shall be with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God.

It is of this day that David sings in his last words: “And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain” (2 Sam. 23:4). And again: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of Thy power; in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: Thou hast the dew of Thy youth” (Psalm 110:3).

Of the congregation of God the prophet Micah speaks, when he says in the fifth chapter: “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.”

— Of the congregation Zephaniah prophesies, when he says in the third chapter: “I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.” And to this afflicted and poor people it is said: “The LORD is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more. The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save; He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love; He will joy over thee with singing.”

Time would fail us, were we to recount all the good words with which the Lord has proclaimed the congregation in the Old Testament; only this word of Zechariah shall we set down here:

“Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is My fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn Mine hand upon the little ones. And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on My name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is My people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God” (Zech. 13:7–9).
