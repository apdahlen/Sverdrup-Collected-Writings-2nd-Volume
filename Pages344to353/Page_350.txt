STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden – not merely “congregation” but the Church as a spiritual body.
* Kald – vocation/divine calling, not occupation.
* Ydmyghed – humility in a theological, God-oriented sense.
* Uværdighed / Udygtighed – unworthiness and incapacity before God.
* Rum – spiritual space or room, not physical.
* Samfund – communion/fellowship, ecclesial union.
* fuldkomment – complete/mature in Christ, not moral perfectionism.
* Grene – branches, metaphorical divisions.
* udvortes – outward/external, ecclesial visibility.
* kjødelige – fleshly/carnal in Pauline sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with theological pivots.
* Parallel triadic structures.
* Sermonic flow that resists sentence fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of Church as Body of Christ and dwelling of the Spirit.
* Soteriology: cleansing by blood, reconciliation with the Father.
* Ecclesiology: visible vs invisible church.
* Regeneration vs nominal membership.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone.
* Direct address to conscience.
* Warning against worldly methods in church growth.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “vandre sit Kald værdig” – biblical idiom (cf. Eph. 4:1), KJV: “walk worthy of the vocation.”
* “Kristi Legeme” – Pauline ecclesiology (1 Cor. 12; Eph. 1).
* “Guds Aands Bolig” – echo of 1 Cor. 3:16.
* “Blodet” – sacrificial atonement language (Hebrews).
* “overgang fra Døden til Livet” – John 5:24.
* “kjødelige og verdslige Overtalelsesmidler” – Pauline critique (1 Cor. 2).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening question: how the Church must walk worthily.
* Threefold calling: humility, love, unity in diversity.
* Practical orientation: dividing church work into inward and outward growth.
* Eschatological limitation: Church incomplete until Christ’s return.
* Pastoral realism: presence of unregenerate members.
* Ethical warning: no excuse for worldliness in entry or recruitment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 4 (walk worthy; one body, many gifts).
* Colossians 1:28 – presenting every man perfect in Christ.
* John 5:24 – death to life.
* 1 Corinthians 3 & 12 – body and Spirit imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain gravity in warnings.
* Preserve earnest pastoral realism.
* No softening of judgment on worldly methods.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “kræver” rendered as “demands” or “requires,” not “suggests.”
* Negative obligations preserved (“ingen Undskyldning”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden – Church
* Kald – calling/vocation
* Kristi Legeme – Body of Christ
* Aand – Spirit
* Kjærlighed – love (agape context)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body, growth, branches, dwelling preserved as metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* High calling contrasted with human deficiency.
* Hopeful growth vs sobering warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences with semicolon logic.
* Preserve rhythmic enumerations.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

How then shall the Church walk worthy of its calling?

The high calling to be the Body of the risen Saviour and the dwelling-place of God’s Spirit demands the deepest humility; for only in the consciousness of our own unworthiness and incapacity is there room for God’s Spirit and for God’s glory.

The all-embracing calling to gather all souls at the cross of Jesus Christ, that they may be cleansed by the blood and reconciled with the Father, demands the greatest love; for only in Christ is salvation, and therefore it is only the love of Christ that can constrain us to seek the salvation of souls.

The one great goal—to gather all into the fellowship of Christ and to present every human being complete in Christ Jesus—demands one Spirit and a diversity of gifts, so that, despite the many ministries and powers, there may yet be no confusion or distraction, but that the many small abilities and gifts may, through the uniting and ordering power of the Holy Spirit, work toward the same goal.

If, then, we attempt to orient ourselves somewhat more closely within this activity of the Church, in order to answer to its name and its calling, it may perhaps be most convenient to divide it into two branches, which nevertheless stand in the most intimate connection with one another:

* The inward growth of the Body of Christ unto its edification in love.
* The outward growth of the Body of Christ, to embrace all human beings, the whole fallen race.

For there is room for growth or advance in both directions. In its earthly existence before the return of Christ, the Church is never perfect or complete or finished. It is perfected precisely at the return of Christ; therefore it is not perfect at any earlier point in time. Until that time it is continually in progress and development.

In the inner life of the Church there is always this deficiency in the earthly Church: that not in all who are drawn into the Church and attach themselves to it is there a true transition from death to life; many dead and sleeping persons follow along into the outward Church, or grow up in its midst. This is an unavoidable calamity, for which the Redeemer Himself has prepared us through His revelation. It therefore constitutes no excuse, either for those who enter the Church with a worldly mind, nor for those who even dare to employ fleshly and worldly means of persuasion in order to move anyone to join the Church.
