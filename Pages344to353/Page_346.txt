STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" — must be rendered consistently as "the Church" (not merely congregation), with ecclesiological weight.
* "Husholdning" — Pauline term (oikonomia); render as "dispensation" rather than household.
* "Raad" — eternal counsel/decree; avoid modern "plan".
* "Forjættelserne" — biblical "promises" in covenantal sense.
* "Tidernes Fylde" — technical Pauline phrase (Gal. 4:4; Eph. 1:10).
* "Afgudstempler" — idolatrous temples; avoid neutral wording.
* "Afmagt" / "Daarlighed" — moral and spiritual impotence/foolishness, not mere weakness.
* "Naadens Rigdom" — Pauline phrase; retain richness.
* "kjøbt" — redemption language; "bought" / "purchased".
* "Ager" — biblical agrarian metaphor (1 Cor. 3:9).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long, cascading sentences with semicolon logic.
* Rhetorical accumulations (rise/fall, build/collapse) that must not be fragmented.
* Parenthetical theological clarifications embedded mid-sentence.

Theological Hazards:

* Trinitarian action (Father, Son, Spirit) must remain explicit.
* Doctrine of election, redemption by blood, and ecclesiology must not be softened.
* Salvation as corporate (Church) and personal (souls) must be preserved.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic, elevated exhortational tone.
* KJV-like biblical resonance.
* Avoid modern academic flattening or explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Tidernes Fylde" — echoes Galatians 4:4; render "the fulness of the times".
* "Riger opstød og Riger gik tilgrunde" — idiomatic parallelism; preserve rhythmic rise/fall.
* "Verdens Magt var bevist at være Afmagt" — paradox; KJV resonance with 1 Cor. 1.
* "byde den udtømte og fattige Verden" — gracious invitation imagery.
* "Hvedekornet" — John 12:24; must remain recognizable.
* "Guds Ager" — 1 Corinthians 3:9; KJV phrasing preferred.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church is precious, chosen, and beloved of the Lord.
* Historical-theological sweep: God’s providence through history aimed at the Church.
* Negative contrast: World powers and wisdom exposed as futile.
* Climactic pivot: The hour of grace arrives through Son and Spirit.
* Heightened valuation: The Church’s worth magnified by redemption through Christ’s blood.
* Christological focus: Incarnation, death, resurrection serve one end—the Church.
* Concluding image: Christ as the grain of wheat bearing fruit in redeemed souls.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 4:4; Ephesians 1:10 — "fulness of the times".
* John 3:16 — God giving His only-begotten Son.
* Acts 20:28 — Church purchased with His own blood.
* John 12:24 — Grain of wheat dying to bear much fruit.
* 1 Corinthians 3:9 — God’s field.
* 1 Corinthians 1 — Worldly wisdom and power shown as folly.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain awe-filled contemplation.
* Preserve sharp antithesis between God’s kingdom and worldly futility.
* Maintain exalted Christological focus without sentimentalization.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and divine intention rendered with "must," "was," "should" where appropriate.
* Avoid weakening purposive clauses.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → Church
* Rige → Kingdom
* Naade → Grace
* Forjættelse → Promise
* Frelses / Salighed → Salvation / everlasting blessedness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Grain of wheat, field, fruit retained verbatim.
* World exhausted/poor preserved as moral-spiritual image.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Majestic providential overview → intense redemptive focus.
* Judgment of the world → consolation of grace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Semicolons and cumulative clauses maintained for pulpit rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

If we then would consider how precious, chosen, and beloved the Church of the Lord is unto Him, it is set before us that the eternal counsel concerning the New Testament dispensation, which is the Church, has been made manifest through the revelation and working of the love of the triune God throughout all generations.

With the purpose of bringing forth the Church in the fulness of the times, God gave the promises, called Abraham, chose Israel, and led His people in wondrous ways; kingdoms arose and kingdoms fell, idol temples were raised and again sank into ruins, the nations exerted their strength in vain attempts to build an everlasting kingdom and to gather imperishable wisdom and power; yet the Lord had His Kingdom and His Church in view in all this, and when the power of the world had been proven to be impotence, and its wisdom folly, and its joy nothing but transience, then the hour of the Lord had come to offer the exhausted and poor world the riches of grace through the Son and the Spirit.

And if even this is great and precious to behold, how the whole governance of the Father over the world points toward the Church and its coming into being and growth, infinitely greater still does the worth of the Church become when we consider that it has been purchased with the blood of the Son. For so God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son over unto death for its salvation, and so has the Son loved, that He came, through a life of suffering and through His death upon the cross, to purchase for Himself the Church with His own blood. The birth, death, and resurrection of the Son have this one purpose, that the Kingdom of God, which is the Church, should come, unto the honor and praise of God, and unto the everlasting blessedness of human souls. For He Himself, the only-begotten Son of God, would be the grain of wheat which falls into the earth and dies, in order that it might spring up and bear much fruit—a fruit which shows itself across the earth in the Church, which is the field of God, whose glorious harvest is the souls that are saved by the love of God and by the grace in Christ Jesus.
