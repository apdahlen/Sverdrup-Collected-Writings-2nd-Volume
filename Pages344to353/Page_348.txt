STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed: not merely “congregation,” but the Church as a spiritual body.
* Afsøden: literally “death” or “dying off,” here spiritual dying to the world.
* Gudsliv: the life of God, not moral improvement.
* Kaar: conditions or circumstances of life, often providential.
* Forfægtes: persecuted, assailed.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with theological pivots joined by semicolons and commas.
* Repeated anaphoric structures (“Derfor er… Der er…”) that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Union with Christ in death and resurrection.
* Distinction between Church and world.
* Pauline doctrine of the Body of Christ and gifts of the Spirit.
* Ecclesiology grounded in resurrection life, not sociology.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic cadence and exhortational solemnity.
* Sharp contrasts between world and Church must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Død med ham og opreist med ham” echoes Romans 6 and Colossians 2–3.
* “Ikke mange vise, ikke mange rige” echoes 1 Corinthians 1:26.
* “Miste alt for at vinde Guds Rige” echoes Matthew 16:25.
* KJV-style phrasing naturally fits these Pauline and Gospel echoes.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church is united with Christ in death and resurrection.
* Development: Therefore it is not worldly, ethnic, cultural, or civilizational.
* Clarification: Diversity of gifts does not negate unity of life.
* Conclusion: Because its life is Christ’s resurrected life, the Church cannot die.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Romans 6:5–9 (death and resurrection with Christ)
* 1 Corinthians 12 (one body, many members)
* Ephesians 3:21 (glory to God in the Church through all ages)

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain solemn declarative force.
* Preserve sharp antitheses: world vs. Church, death vs. life.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Kan ikke” rendered as “cannot,” not “does not usually.”
* Necessity and consequence retained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Church
* Liv = Life
* Verden = the world
* Gaver = gifts

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery retained.
* Life/death metaphors preserved without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward the world; consolation in the Church’s immortality.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Clause rhythm respected.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

This is Christ’s mystery and the Church’s holy riddle: dead with Him and raised with Him, God’s Church is not of the world and yet is in the world. And because the Church is thus fellowship with the risen and ascended Savior, therefore this fellowship is independent of earthly circumstances and conditions. The Church is not an earthly people, such that it depends upon having the right human forefather, or the right color, or the right earthly fatherland, or the right language. Nor is it a particular caste or class or age or school of cultivation. For the Church is not a higher form of worldly life, nor a more or less developed stage of civilization; but it is a new life of God among men, a life which can be found only where a dying away from the world has taken place. Human conditions come into consideration only insofar as it is difficult for those who are something and have something in the world to die away from the worldly and receive the life of God. Therefore not many wise, not many rich, not many noble have been brought into the Church; for it cost them too much to lose all in order to win the Kingdom of God. Therefore also within the Church there is neither rank nor caste, higher or lower strata. There is the essential equality that follows from having the same Father, while there is the necessary difference that follows from one being young and another old, one having one gift for labor, another a different gift. There is the essential unity that belongs to the body of Jesus Christ by virtue of the one Spirit. There is also the difference and manifoldness that arise from this, that the one Spirit distributes His gifts and gives to each individual believer the gifts as He wills.

But if the Church is thus life out of death, or the life of the risen Lord Jesus Christ, then it follows that the Church can die no more. Its true and essential life is the life of Jesus Christ, which has already passed through death and therefore dieth no more. Not only does the Church possess vitality enough to exist so long as the earth stands and the times endure; but through all times and all generations and all eternities God is revealed and praised and honored through the Church, which is His Son’s, our Lord Jesus Christ’s, living body, which indeed can suffer, be tormented, and be assailed by the world, but which, despite all mistreatment, nevertheless lives the risen One’s eternal life in the midst of the world of transitoriness.
