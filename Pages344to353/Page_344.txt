STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" vs. modern "congregation/church": carries theological weight as the Spirit-created body.
* "Undergjerning": miracle/wondrous act with biblical resonance.
* "Forjættelsen": promise in a covenantal, scriptural sense.
* "Talsmanden": Johannine term (Paraclete), not merely "advocate".
* "Sandhedens Aand": fixed biblical phrase.
* "livlige Vidnesbyrd": living/vivid testimony, not emotionalism.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, paratactic sentences with repeated "og da" clauses.
* Sermonic pacing that must not be fragmented.
* Embedded Scripture quotation setting rhetorical frame.

Theological Hazards:

* Pentecost as divine act, not human organization.
* Church as fruit of Christ’s death and resurrection.
* Role of the ascended Christ in sending the Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, proclamatory tone.
* Exhortational cadence addressed to the believing conscience.
* Risk of modernizing away biblical gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kommer et Land til Verden paa een Dag" echoes Isaiah 66:8; KJV cadence should be retained.
* "et helt Folk født paa én Gang" is prophetic fulfillment language.
* Storm and tongues of fire echo Acts 2; imagery must remain vivid and scriptural.
* "Guds store Gjerninger" aligns with Acts 2:11 ("the wonderful works of God").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening Scripture sets the theme.
* Identification of the prophecy’s fulfillment at Pentecost.
* Negation of human causality.
* Affirmation of divine grace through Christ’s work.
* Climactic description of the Spirit’s descent and the Church’s birth.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 66:8 (explicit quotation).
* John 14–16: Promise of the Comforter/Spirit of truth.
* Acts 2: Pentecost imagery (wind, fire, tongues, testimony).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain declarative certainty.
* Preserve wonder and doxological weight.
* Avoid explanatory dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Divine action expressed as accomplished fact.
* No weakening of necessity or fulfillment.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Church.
* Aanden = the Spirit.
* Forjættelsen = the promise.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Birth imagery retained.
* Storm and fire imagery retained without allegorizing.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From prophetic question to triumphant fulfillment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long cumulative sentence preserved with rhythmic "and when" clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Sixth Section.

[As a conclusion to this volume, there has in this section been included a series of lectures which all— with the exception of the last—were delivered at the annual meetings of the Augsburg Confessors and the Lutheran Free Church. The final lecture—The Unity of Believers—was written for a church gathering in Hatton, North Dakota, in the winter of 1907. As it was not possible for the author to be personally present, the lecture was read aloud by one of the participants in the meeting. It was later published in “Luthersk Tidskrift.” —Ed.]

1. Congregation and Congregational Life.

[Source: Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Augsburg Confessors, 1896, pp. 59–70. —Ed.]

The Congregation.

“Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day, or shall a nation be brought forth at once?”
Isa. 66:8.

The wondrous work which Isaiah thus proclaims is the birth of the Church through the outpouring of the Spirit on the feast of Pentecost. The Church did not come into being through any human exertion of strength or clever calculation; it came as a gift of grace from God, a glorious fruit of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; for the ascended Savior fulfilled the promise which He gave the disciples before His death, concerning the Comforter whom He would send, and the Spirit of truth whom He would give them; and when the Spirit came, and when the storm rushed with mighty power, and when tongues as of fire rested upon each one of the disciples, and when the living testimony of the Spirit concerning the great works of God resounded in the many tongues—then the Church stood there, “a whole nation born at once.”
