STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Forkyndelse – not mere “preaching” but authoritative proclamation of the Word.
* aandfuld – Spirit-filled, not emotional.
* skriftmæssig – scriptural in substance, normed by Scripture.
* alsidig – many-sided, full-orbed, not merely “varied.”
* oplades – charged, filled, set aflame.
* nidkjære – zealous with holy zeal.
* Legemets Vækst – Pauline metaphor (Eph. 4), not generic growth.
* Afsøndring – separation/consecration, not social withdrawal.
* Forsagelse – renunciation with baptismal resonance.
* Selvfornægtelse – self-denial in Christological sense.
* Hedningeverdenen – the pagan world; must retain missional gravity.
* missionerer – active evangelistic sending, not abstract concern.
* Fjerdedeshed – moreover/furthermore; archaic connective.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with theological pivots joined by commas and semicolons.
* Parallel constructions (“paa den ene Side … paa den anden Side”).
* Sermonic accumulations that should not be broken into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between living/free congregation and dead/false church.
* Doctrine of sanctification as separation and love.
* Theology of the Spirit as inherently missional.
* Suffering and hatred as marks of true love.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressed to conscience.
* Sharp polemic against worldliness and dead Christianity.
* Pastoral seriousness without sentimentality.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Ordets Forkyndelse” echoes Romans 10 and Lutheran theology of the Word as means of grace.
* “Legemets Vækst” echoes Ephesians 4:16 (body growing unto itself in love).
* “den trange … Vei” echoes Matthew 7:14 (the narrow way).
* “Verdens Kulde og Mørke” – Johannine imagery of light vs darkness.
* “lever i Kjærlighed … lever … under Had” echoes John 15:18–19.
* “Jordens Ender” echoes Acts 1:8.
  KJV-style equivalents are natural and should be used where possible.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. If the Word is preached rightly, the congregation grows inwardly and outwardly.
2. True growth manifests as knowledge, love, and zeal focused on salvation and God’s kingdom.
3. Inner growth shows itself in separation, self-denial, and sacrificial love.
4. This work begins inside the congregation (children, seekers, believers).
5. It necessarily extends outward in mission.
6. A congregation without mission is congregation in name only.
7. Living faithfully brings hatred from the world and the dead church.
8. True friends of life and salvation will rejoice and lead in the struggle.
9. The passage ends by pointing to the priestly role within the free congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 4:15–16 – growth of the body.
* Matthew 7:14 – the narrow way.
* John 1 / John 8 – light and darkness.
* Acts 1:8 – unto the ends of the earth.
* John 15:18–20 – hatred from the world.
  These echoes should sound familiar to a KJV-shaped ear.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against dead Christianity and worldliness must remain sharp.
No softening of hatred, conflict, or sacrifice.
Maintain exhortational urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “vil” and “skal” rendered as “shall / will” with necessity.
* Negative absolutes (“ikke … uden i Navn”) preserved without mitigation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation (consistent).
* Verden – the world.
* Kjærlighed – love (agape sense).
* Aand – Spirit (capitalized when divine).
* Frelse – salvation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light vs darkness preserved.
* Body growth imagery retained.
* Warfare/struggle language retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Growth and joy contrasted with hatred and conflict.
* Consolation alongside warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Parallel clauses mirrored.
* Suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Therefore, if the proclamation of the Word becomes truly powerful and Spirit-filled, scriptural and full-orbed, and if hearts are kindled and the members of the congregation become zealous in word and in deed, then the congregation shall grow with the growth of the body, both inwardly and outwardly. Knowledge and understanding shall increase, and love shall become more inward and more comprehensive. And the congregation shall gain greater adherence and draw more to itself, when all its members live for this one thing alone: the salvation of souls and the spreading of the kingdom of God.

The congregation’s inward growth will therefore show itself in a stronger separation and distinction from the world, in greater renunciation and self-denial, and in a more self-sacrificing love for souls, so that on the one hand the light stands out sharply from the darkness, and on the other hand the light draws and lifts those who still walk in the coldness and darkness of the world. Yet this is a work that is first of all exercised within the congregation. There the baptized children are to be reared, instructed, and enlightened, that they may remain upon the narrow way of renunciation and faith; there the seeking are to be borne; there the believing are to be strengthened and guided, encouraged and admonished. And then outward, in the heathen world, there is work enough to be done in order that the Gospel may be proclaimed. And the congregation that does not engage in mission is no congregation except in name; for the Spirit of God is a Spirit who drives to labor for the spreading of the kingdom of God unto the ends of the earth.

When the Christian congregation thus becomes conscious of its calling and begins to live therein, it shall ever more experience that if it lives in love, it lives under hatred. Not only shall the living congregation be repaid with the hatred of the world, because it is an offense to the world to labor for its salvation. But the living congregation will, if possible, be hated even more by the false and dead church, which in the awakened life of the congregation will see its own worldliness judged. Furthermore, all those who have worldly advantage from the congregation’s death and ignorance and inactivity will become bitter enemies of the free and living congregation. But those whose delight it is that souls be saved and life be brought forth, they will with joy greet the free and living congregation and rejoice to be allowed, if it be given them, to go before it in its struggle, labor, and tribulations. That is the place of the priests in the free congregation,
