STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighederne / Menigheden" – congregation understood theologically, not merely sociological.
* "Præsterne" – ordained clergy with sacramental and pastoral office.
* "Kald" – divine vocation, not employment.
* "Vekkelse" – spiritual awakening/revival with pietistic weight.
* "Hyrde og Sjælesørger" – biblical-pastoral metaphors.
* "verdslige Præst" – spiritually worldly, not secular in modern sense.
* "Fuldendelsen" – eschatological consummation.
* "Herlighed" – divine glory, eschatological.
* "Paulun" – tabernacle/dwelling of God, biblical term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological buildup.
* Parallel clauses joined by semicolons and commas.
* Rhetorical contrasts (true shepherd vs worldly priest).

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of vocation, revival, perseverance of Christ’s life.
* Resurrection imagery tied to sanctification and glorification.
* Eschatology: New Jerusalem, Lamb’s throne, God dwelling with man.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic exhortation must not be flattened.
* Earnest Lutheran confidence must not become speculative or sentimental.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "blir det for trangt" – metaphor for spiritual displacement; rendered as “too strait / too narrow.”
* "Menigheden lever i Haab" – theological hope, not optimism.
* Water lily rising from mud – sanctification/glorification imagery.
* "mange Vandes Lyd" – Revelation imagery; KJV phrasing preserved.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Addressing fear that awakened congregations marginalize clergy.
* Reassurance: true pastors flourish amid awakening.
* Contrast with worldly clergy who feel displaced.
* Transition to eschatological hope of the Church.
* Climactic vision of final consummation in Revelation language.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Shepherd imagery – John 10.
* Resurrection life – Romans 6; 1 Corinthians 15.
* Lily/waters – implicit Psalmic/prophetic imagery.
* Lamb’s throne; New Jerusalem; God dwelling with men – Revelation 7, 21.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings to worldly clergy remain firm.
* Hope is confident, not tentative.
* Final vision exalted and doxological.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" / "vil" retained as strong necessity and certainty.
* No weakening to possibility or suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = Church / congregation (capitalized when theological).
* Herlighed = glory.
* Liv = Life (often capitalized when Christological).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Lily, grave, throne, tabernacle retained fully.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemical opening → hopeful middle → triumphant conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved with semicolons.
* KJV-like rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

There are those who fear that, when the congregations awaken, the space will become too constrained for the pastors. This fear is unfounded, provided the pastors understand their task and their calling. When awakening comes to a congregation, the faithful shepherd and caretaker of souls will find both labor and sympathy, both afflictions and joys. But the worldly-minded pastor will indeed encounter many difficulties where the work of God’s Spirit begins in the congregation, and perhaps the room will become too narrow for him.

The Church lives in hope; for the consummation cannot fail to come; the Life of Christ cannot slumber without attaining unto its eternal blossoming in glory. It is the water lily which, from the turbid depths, shoots upward toward the clear sunshine beneath God’s heaven. That Life which springs forth from Christ’s dark grave in His resurrection from the dead; that Life of God and of His Spirit’s eternal love, which is lived amid hatred and persecution, tribulation and contempt—this Life at last reaches unto eternal glory.

Then the Church is consummated, when all her faithful and true members are gathered before the throne of the Lamb, and from the depths of their hearts the song of praise surges forth, mighty and full-toned as the sound of many waters. Then shall the New Jerusalem, the holy city, descend out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her bridegroom; and then shall the tabernacle of God, in eternal perfection, be with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God. Amen.
