* "Vandel" — manner of life, conduct before God.
* "Kald" — divine calling/vocation with obligation.
* "fordærver" — destroy/corrupt with judgment implications.
* "Omgjængelse" — manner of mutual life and dealings.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological buildup.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative biblical titles.
* Embedded Scripture quotations.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be broken.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as God’s dwelling.
* Responsibility and judgment upon the congregation.
* Holiness of Word and Sacrament.
* Corporate responsibility mirroring individual salvation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience.

* "Staden paa Bjerget" / "Lyset paa Lysestagen" — Matt. 5 imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Grounding: Trinitarian purpose and biblical identity of the Church.
* Scriptural warrant: Paul’s exhortation and warning.
* Refutation: Error of dissolving responsibility into the universal church.
* Assertion: Each congregation bears full ecclesial responsibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\textbt{Congregational Life}

Therefore, since the Congregation is the goal of the Father’s providence, of the Son’s birth, death, and resurrection, of the outpouring of the Spirit; since the Congregation is the chosen race, the royal priesthood, the holy nation, the people of God’s own possession, the dwelling of God in the Spirit, the city set upon a hill and the light upon the lampstand—so it is not strange that Paul, who was cast into prison and laid in chains for the sake of this Congregation, writes in the consciousness of this great responsibility to those who were a congregation and called themselves a congregation: “I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called.”

What we here mean by congregational life is nothing other than that manner of walk which corresponds to the high calling of the Congregation. For this calling rests first and foremost upon each individual congregation in every place where Christians gather around the Word of God and Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. If an assembly of believing men and women has taken upon itself the holy name of congregation and begun its holy work with Word and Sacrament in a place, then it has thereby also taken upon itself the calling and the responsibility; and God will judge them accordingly, as Paul writes to the Corinthians: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man destroy the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”

There are so many who seek to escape the great and dreadful responsibility which rests upon the Congregation, by thinking of the whole Christian Church instead of the small individual congregation; and by fixing their attention upon this great and far‑reaching fellowship, the single congregation becomes so insignificant that it seems as though its life and walk and mutual dealings could not be of such great importance, and thus it might more easily and cheaply escape from its calling and responsibility. But nothing can be more corrupting than such a way of thinking. Just as little as the individual soul can be saved in the crowd and mass of Christians without being Christian itself, just so little can the individual congregation escape its calling and its responsibility in the mass of congregations. Where Christ is, there He is either whole, or He is not there at all. Where Christianity is, there it is whole, or else it is not there at all. And each individual congregation by itself has precisely the same calling and task and responsibility as the whole Christian Church; and so heavy is the responsibility, as though it were the only congregation and the entire gathering of congregations.

Let us, in our consideration of the Congregation, try to hold fast to this, so that no one may have occasion to evade the calling with the false consolation that there are so many involved that it is not so exacting with each one.
