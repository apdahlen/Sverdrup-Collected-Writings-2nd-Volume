* "Menighed" – congregation/church in its organic, communal sense.
* "Diakonembedet" – ordained office, not generic service.
* "Uddeling" – formal distribution, likely of food/resources.
* "tjene ved Bordene" – technical phrase from Acts 6; must retain biblical resonance.

* "forestaaes, ordnes og besørges" – overlapping administrative verbs requiring cadence.
* "forurettet" – wronged, treated unjustly.
* "bespiste" – fed/provided with food, not merely assisted.
* "Omsorg" – concrete pastoral care.
* "Embedsgerning" – official ministry, not voluntary action.
* "Godgjørenhed" – charity/almsgiving; risk of modern moralizing tone.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cumulative sentences with causal chains.
* Parenthetical historical explanations embedded in argument.
* Semicolon logic that must not be fragmented.
* Biblical quotation embedded mid-paragraph.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between office and private piety.

Voice Hazards:

* Calm but firm didactic tone.
* Lutheran emphasis on order, office, and vocation.
* Risk of flattening exhortational seriousness into neutral prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Administrative matter treated as spiritually significant.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where argument unfolds.
* Balanced clauses and rhythmic enumeration preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

That which threatened to bring about a division in the first congregation, and which gave rise to the diaconal office, was a complaint that the Greek-speaking widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. It was thus manifestly a question concerning the proper assistance of those in need. And the service which was to rest upon the deacons is said to be this: to serve at the tables. We recall that the first congregation held its property in common. They ate together, and these common meals were therefore to be overseen, ordered, and provided for by the deacons, who were also to see to it that no one was wronged in any respect. From this there followed, as a matter of immediate necessity, that if any member of the congregation could not come to the common meal because sickness or distress hindered him, then the deacons were bound to see to it that such persons also were fed and helped. Thus we find that later in the history of the Church, when the common meals ceased, the direct care of the poor and the sick became the official ministry of the deacons.

It is, however, self-evident that just as far as the pastoral office does not exclude the activity of the laity, so far neither does the diaconal office exclude private charity. We must here remember that in those times the world was full of poor people, and that especially the great cities were, to an extraordinary degree, crowded with the needy and the helpless.

The apostles prescribe in Acts 6:3 that the congregation is to choose men who have a good testimony, who are full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom. And we find that the effect of this new order in the congregation, which brought the complaint to an end and gave the apostles occasion to devote themselves exclusively to the ministry of the Word, was great and blessed. “And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great multitude of the priests were obedient to the faith.” We also find that some of the deacons took a vibrant part in the proclamation of the Word. From this we may conclude that the apostles regarded this office as an exceedingly essential and important link in the development of the congregation. It is evident that they desired the best men of the congregation, and that in those who were chosen they found a great support in their work, and that the congregation reaped a great fruit from thus having the right men in their right place.
