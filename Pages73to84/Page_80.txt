* Forligelse = reconciliation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Footsteps imagery.

* Retain long sentences and rhythmic lists.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Deacon means a servant, and the name is therefore simple and humbling to our flesh; yet it has a wondrous sweetness and beauty for the Christian, for whom it is a name of honor, since the Son of God voluntarily took it upon himself and came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

It is the greatness of all Christians to become small and the servants of all, in order to win them for the eternal life, if it were possible. Thereby they walk in the footsteps of their Lord; they follow him in humility and suffering; they love with him, labor with him, strive with him, devote themselves with him, that the glorious blessing of reconciliation may, both by word and by deed, be brought near unto as many hearts as possible. It belongs especially to Christians to practice the service of love where need and misery have made the sinful earthly life truly wretched, where sin has brought great distress and suffering, and where suffering has often softened hearts, so that they are receptive to the right remedy against both sin and need and death—the precious Gospel of our Lord and Savior. Just as the Savior himself found no entrance among those who were full and rich and had abundance and lacked nothing, but was all the more welcome among those who suffered and were afflicted, so also have Christ’s believers in a special manner become the servants of the suffering and the poor and the outcast, if indeed they have become faithful in the calling wherewith they are called.

The narrative in Acts, chapter 6, shows us clearly how the diaconal office was instituted. And it emerges quite plainly from this account that the deacons were chosen by the congregation to carry out a service which in no way was of a different kind from that which all Christians are bound to show one another. Yet here we find the same circumstance which we earlier touched upon when we spoke of the priestly office and lay activity. All Christians are to be priests and witnesses, and yet the congregation as a whole must have its priest, who is an executor of the whole congregation’s duty of witness; likewise all Christians are to be servants or deacons in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, and yet the congregation as a whole will be able to exercise its duty of service only through particular deacons, chosen thereto. It is also noteworthy that the account in Acts, chapter 6, shows us that this office has its ground in murmuring and dissatisfaction, that it is thus conditioned by imperfection among Christians; from this we may better understand what the Apostle means in Ephesians 4 when he says that the gifts and offices in the congregations are to serve “for the perfecting of the saints.” Through its offices and officeholders the congregation exercises self-control, self-cleansing, and self-edification.
