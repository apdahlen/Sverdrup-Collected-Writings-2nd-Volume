STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Diakon," "Presbyterium," "Presbytere," and "Embedet" carry specific ecclesial meanings rooted in Lutheran and apostolic usage, not modern organizational terms.
* "ærbare" denotes moral gravity and dignity, not merely social respectability.
* "Frimodighed" signifies boldness of faith before God, not psychological confidence.
* "anfægtede" refers to spiritually afflicted or troubled consciences, a technical pietistic term.
* "fri Menighed" indicates congregational structure without hierarchical clericalism.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with multiple subordinate clauses and scriptural insertions must not be broken apart excessively.
* Parenthetical glosses (e.g., "Menighedens Tjenere (Diakoner)") must be preserved rhetorically.
* The text alternates between exposition, citation, and exhortation within single sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Qualifications for church office (1 Timothy 3) must retain doctrinal precision.
* Distinction between diaconal care and presbyteral oversight is ecclesiologically sensitive.
* Poverty, calling, and divine election echo Pauline theology and must not be sociologized.

Voice Hazards:

* The earnest, pastoral, exhortational Lutheran tone must not be flattened.
* Evaluative phrases ("burde læses og betænkes atter og atter") must retain moral urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "een Kvindes Mand" echoes 1 Tim. 3:12; KJV phrasing should be preserved.
* "baner sig selv en god Vej" is metaphorical for spiritual standing and trustworthiness.
* "ikke mange vise efter Kjødet" echoes 1 Cor. 1:26; KJV parallel is natural.
* "for intet at regne" means negligible by comparison, not literally worthless.
* "ligefremme Fattigpleie" contrasts material relief with pastoral care.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Historical development: from Jerusalem church to later congregations.
* Scriptural norm: Paul’s qualifications for deacons.
* Exhortation: these texts should guide present elections.
* Observation: continuity between apostolic and contemporary experience.
* Practical conclusion: diaconal work today focuses less on almsgiving, more on pastoral care.
* Ecclesial reasoning: overlap of diaconal and presbyteral duties is legitimate.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Timothy 3:8–13 quoted extensively.
* 1 Corinthians 1:26 paraphrased ("not many wise after the flesh").
* Implicit Acts 6 background (Jerusalem church organization).
* Pauline theology of calling and service throughout.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain exhortational weight when urging congregations to read and consider Scripture.
* Preserve sober realism when describing poverty and suffering.
* Retain confident ecclesial judgment without apology.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "bør" rendered as "ought" or "should" with moral force.
* "maa" rendered as "must."
* Conditional constructions retain necessity, not suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Menighed" = congregation.
* "Embedet" = office.
* "Fattigpleie" = care of the poor.
* "Frimodighed" = boldness.
* "Tjenere" = ministers/servants (contextually "deacons").

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* "baner sig selv en god Vej" preserved metaphorically.
* Spatial imagery of cities "within their walls" retained.
* Office as a "place" of service preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Didactic Scripture exposition contrasted with pastoral application.
* Historical sobriety balanced with exhortational clarity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorical flow demands.
* Semicolons and colons preserved.
* Scripture quotation cadence follows KJV rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Later, when the Church consisted of many congregations, and the other congregations imitated the congregation in Jerusalem in its organization, we find in 1 Timothy 3:8–13 a description of what a true deacon ought to be. Paul writes concerning this as follows: “Likewise must the ministers of the congregation (deacons) be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, vigilant, faithful in all things. Let the ministers of the congregation be the husband of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well; for they that have used the office well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.” These words, which ought to be read and pondered again and again in our congregations, which each year choose deacons, give the most excellent guidance for choosing the right men; and we all know that in the free congregation it is not a matter of many offices and lofty titles, but of the right men in the right place.

If we now consider our own circumstances and our congregations, it is striking to see how in many ways we find the experience of the apostles confirmed, that not many rich, not many mighty, not many wise after the flesh are called. Among us also there is, in part, poverty and need within the congregations. And yet there is a vast difference, inasmuch as we in this land can form no true conception of the utter helplessness in which thousands of the poor in the apostles’ time were placed. What poverty we see here is as nothing compared with the misery and wretchedness which the great cities of the Roman Empire hid within their walls. A natural consequence of this is that our deacons have comparatively little work with the direct care of the poor, but are instead especially directed to think upon the sick, the dying, and the afflicted as that field of labor to which the Word of God points them.

We must also take note that in the apostolic congregations there was commonly a chosen presbyterium alongside the deacons. We do not choose several pastors, but only one pastor; and from this it will follow quite naturally that our deacons, who often together with the pastor form the congregational council, also come to deal with various matters which in the earliest time belonged more properly to the presbyters. In this there is nothing improper. For those who are fit for the office of deacon are also fit for the office of presbyter; and where the care of the poor recedes so far into the background as it does in our congregations, it would not be necessary to have a separate congregational office devoted exclusively to that matter.
