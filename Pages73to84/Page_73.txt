STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Præsteembedet" – denotes the ordained pastoral office; must not be reduced to a generic "ministry".
* "Lægmandsprestsomheden" – literally "the layman-priesthood"; doctrinally tied to the priesthood of all believers.
* "Læreembede" – teaching office with formal authority, not merely the act of teaching.
* "fri Forstaaelse" – free exercise or free understanding; implies spiritual liberty, not doctrinal relativism.
* "Menighed" – congregation/church body; must be rendered consistently.
* "ydre Kald" – outward call; technical Lutheran term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, layered sentences with subordinate clauses and biblical citations.
* Parallel constructions contrasting ordained office and general Christian witness.
* Sermonic cadence relying on balance rather than brevity.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between ordained ministry and priesthood of all believers.
* Doctrine of spiritual gifts given by Christ through the Spirit.
* Role of congregational election under divine guidance.
* The indwelling of Christ’s Word among all believers.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, didactic Lutheran tone.
* Exhortational balance without polemic exaggeration.
* Risk of flattening pastoral seriousness into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Ord bo rigelig iblandt eder" – direct biblical idiom (Col. 3:16); KJV phrasing should be echoed.
* "opvakte dem i Menighedens Midte" – spiritually raised up; not merely appointed.
* "ved sine Gaver var duelige" – qualified through spiritual gifts, not credentials.
* "af troende Hjerter og Livets Erfaring" – experiential faith language common to pietistic Lutheranism.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The New Testament testifies to both an ordained teaching office and the free spiritual participation of all believers.
* Support: Pauline texts demonstrating ordained offices (Ephesians) and universal exhortation (Colossians).
* Clarification: Ordained ministers are divinely gifted and congregationally chosen.
* Counterbalance: All believers, regardless of office, are called to confess Christ.
* Conclusion: The church requires both ordered office and living witness from all members.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 4:11–12 – offices given by Christ for edification of the body.
* Acts 6:5; 14:23 – congregational election.
* Acts 20:28 – oversight by the Holy Spirit.
* Acts 13:2 – laying on of hands.
* Colossians 3:16 – mutual teaching through psalms and spiritual songs.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain declarative confidence without polemics.
* Preserve ecclesial seriousness and pastoral clarity.
* Avoid softening the necessity of church order.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan negte" – must retain impossibility: "no one can deny".
* "er derfor" – logical necessity: "it is therefore".
* "er et ligesaa alvorligt Krav" – equally serious requirement.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Embede = office
* Aand = Spirit
* Ord = Word
* Opbyggelse = edification

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* "Kristi Legeme" – Body of Christ retained as metaphor.
* "bo iblandt" – dwelling imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Doctrinal exposition balanced with pastoral exhortation.
* Institutional necessity paired with spiritual vitality.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with semicolon logic.
* Retain rhythmic parallelism suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\textbf{The Pastoral Office and the Priesthood of the Laity}

The New Testament bears clear witness that the first Christian congregations possessed both a distinct teaching office and a free exercise of the Lord’s Word in their midst. To the Ephesians Paul writes: “And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:11–12). No one can deny that reference is made here to persons who, by their gifts, were qualified to be the congregation’s officers. Christ Himself gave them these gifts, raised them up in the midst of the congregation; the congregation chose them (Acts 6:5; 14:23) under the powerful cooperation of the Spirit of God (Acts 20:28), and laid hands upon them (Acts 13:2).

To the Colossians the same apostle writes: “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs” (Col. 3:16). And again no one can deny that here the apostle speaks of each and every believer without any regard to congregational election or to any sort of “outward call.” All who have the Spirit of Christ are here exhorted to praise the Lord’s Name for salvation, in such a manner that it may be unto edification for those who hear.

It is therefore a matter of first importance for the Church of Christ to have an ordered office in its midst, filled through the election of the congregation. It is an equally serious requirement laid upon the congregation, that its members bear witness to their Saviour from believing hearts and from the lived experience.
