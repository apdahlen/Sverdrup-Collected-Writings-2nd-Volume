STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Most of the regulations governing the activity of deacons in our congregations are directed toward this end: that the deacons are to be the pastor’s assistants in the spiritual care of the congregation; that they are to visit the poor, the sick, and the afflicted; that they are thus to be the congregation’s chosen and commissioned servants, appointed to carry out, on behalf of the congregation and with responsibility to it, a work which in private also rests upon every individual Christian. But since the charity and help of the individual in every kind of distress always has something accidental about it and cannot be relied upon to reach everywhere, and may even lack the proper wisdom and insight, the congregation also, as a public body, must strive to have this ministry rightly performed through chosen men.

If, then, great care was required in the apostolic congregations in the choice of deacons, this is surely no less the case in our own day. Or have our congregations advanced further in faith in Christ and in fitness to serve one another? We must rather lament that sin and unfaithfulness in the work have increased within the congregations. It entails a great responsibility to possess the freedom and right of election of the apostolic congregations; for if we do not choose with insight and with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we hinder the kingdom of God from coming to us, in that we obstruct the proper application of the gifts to labor in the congregation. But if we rightly esteem the Lord’s manifold gifts and the workings of the Spirit in the various persons, then we know that small means can accomplish wondrous things in the kingdom of God, provided they are used in the right place and in the Lord’s service.

It is a serious matter in the free congregation to elect all its office-bearers, and it is a very burdensome task to be an office-bearer in the free congregation. This applies especially to the pastor and the deacons. What should in particular be the deacon’s striving is the imitation of Jesus as helper and comforter in the manifold distresses which congregational life presents. Even if poverty is not precisely in these days the greatest outward distress within our congregations, it is nevertheless far from the case that life has thereby been freed from misery. In a thousand forms the misery of sin confronts us also among ourselves. There is sickness; there is drunkenness; there is family discord; there is unbelief and despair; there are temptations of every kind. Who can count all the forms of sorrow and distress, who can count the tears that are shed, often where no one suspects it? But to enter into the house of sorrow and the dwelling of need, and to receive grace to wipe away a tear, to comfort a heart, to guide one who has gone astray, to admonish one who is disorderly—this is the lovely work which the congregation lays upon its deacons. May the Lord grant that there be many who are fit for this work, many who are faithful in its often heavy exercise.

For the pastoral ministry the diaconate is an indispensable support in our congregations. They can give notice of sickness and spiritual distress here and there; they can be with the sick when the pastor cannot. They can assist in edifying services; they can conduct worship when the pastor is hindered. They can pray with him and give counsel and help where a solitary man may often be both at a loss and helpless. It is immediately evident that it is precisely the same now as in apostolic times: if the pastor is to be the holder of all offices and perform all works in the congregation, then his chief work is neglected; he receives so many tasks that one hinders the other. Such a condition is equally unhealthy for congregation and for pastor; regrettably, congregations in many places would gladly have it so, and in still more places pastors themselves would gladly have it so. Yet many there are also among us who are faithful and discerning pastors, who recognize that the freedom and life of the congregation, and the heavy responsibility proper to the pastoral office, require a division of labor. May they become more and more among us; then they would also, through steady labor for this cause, experience that the congregations even in our day do not lack the gifts of the Spirit for their own edification. But where nothing is done to test the congregation’s strength, one may be certain that the strength and the gifts will hide themselves; yet the congregation will incur guilt, because it buried its talent in the earth.
