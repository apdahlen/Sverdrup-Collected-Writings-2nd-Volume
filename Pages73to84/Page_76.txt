STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed," "Menighedslemmer," "Præstevalg," "Embedet," "Opbyggelse," "Nidkjærhed," "Katholicisme" – ecclesial terms with confessional weight; must avoid modern dilution.
* "Vidnepligt," "Gjerning," "Aandens Gaver" – pietistic-lutheran vocabulary requiring stable equivalents.
* "mageligste" – not merely "easy" but spiritually complacent.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic and concessive clauses.
* Argument unfolds through contrast and negation; must not be broken into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between office (ministerium) and priesthood of all believers.
* Condemnation of clericalism labeled "Katholicisme" in a Lutheran polemical sense.
* Limits of lay testimony governed by edification and unity of the Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation and warning against spiritual sloth.
* Pastoral yet polemical tone must remain firm and solemn.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Vidne om Frelseren i Ord og Gjerning" – echoes Acts and Johannine witness; KJV-style "bear witness".
* "Alt ske til Opbyggelse" – 1 Corinthians 14:26; retain exact phrasing.
* "Guds Forsamling" – biblical term for the gathered church.
* "ren Katholicisme" – idiomatic Lutheran critique of sacerdotal monopoly.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The pastor is entrusted with communal labor in the Word, but this does not abolish individual Christian duty.
* Antithesis: Clerical monopolization vs. congregational passivity.
* Doctrinal proof: Scripture portrays all Christians as living, working, witnessing members.
* Clarification: The call of a pastor establishes, not cancels, lay activity.
* Metaphor: Office as trunk; believers as branches.
* Practical regulation: Edification as the sole governing rule.
* Conclusion: Legitimate limitation arises from earthly vocations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Corinthians 12–14: gifts, one Spirit, edification.
* Ephesians 4:16: building up of the body.
* Acts 1:8; John 15: witness and fruit-bearing.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp critique of laziness and false ecclesiology.
* Preserve earnest pastoral admonition without softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa," "skal," "kan" rendered as "must," "shall," "cannot" where appropriate.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Embedet = the office
* Opbyggelse = edification
* Gjerning = work

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Trunk/branches metaphor retained without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning against extremes followed by ordered pastoral balance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved; commas and semicolons maintained for sermonic rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It is therefore the congregation’s great common labor with the Word of God, inwardly and outwardly, which is most immediately entrusted to the pastor; yet it is very far from being the case that thereby all the individual members’ Christian duty is laid upon him. The duty of Christians, each in his own place, to bear witness to the Savior in word and deed thus remains resting upon them. There are pastors who would gladly be alone in the activity and life of the congregation, who would gladly have their congregation become a dead mass that neither lives nor works; for that is the easiest thing for the pastor. And there are congregation members enough who would gladly have the pastor both live and work in their stead; for that is the easiest thing for them. But this is in any case nothing other than sheer Catholicism, and it ought not to find spokesmen within the Lutheran Church. Holy Scripture describes the individual Christians to us as both living and working, witnessing and prophesying, and it is altogether inadmissible to let all this be done on one’s behalf by a salaried pastor in the name of the office.

It therefore stands fast that the congregation’s call of a pastor does not abolish the Christians’ activity for the building up of Christ’s body, but rather confirms it. The pastoral call places in the midst of the congregation a living center for the work of the congregation, and around the labor of the pastoral office there gathers the individual Christians’ work of edification. The office is like the firm trunk of the work, which unceasingly is active in bringing nourishment to the other branches of labor. The work of the office is regular and fixedly prescribed and orderly determined; the work of the individual Christians is more dependent upon occasion and circumstance, upon the Spirit’s particular gifts and impulses. It is the concern of the congregation to watch over this: that the work of the office be carried out with zeal, and that the activity of the individual members take place unto edification and not unto disturbance in the assembly of God.

But how far, then, does the individual Christian’s duty of witness extend? Can any law or rule be set for it? The Word of God gives this general rule: “Let all things be done unto edification.” And the Word testifies that each one shall use his gift for the edification of the congregation in the one and the same Spirit. It is exceedingly dangerous to draw other boundaries. Naturally, it says itself that under extraordinary conditions of distress the duty of the individual may extend so far that he must directly seek to perform the work of the office, although this in free congregations is almost unthinkable, for the reason that the congregation will then intervene and seek to remedy the distress in a regular and orderly manner. But under ordinary circumstances, when the office is carried on in the right spirit and according to the Word of God, there is no other rule to be given than that which is set by the diversity of the gifts and the unity of the Spirit in connection with the various earthly callings. For there arises a necessary and justified limitation upon the individual members’ work of edification from this very fact, that each has his own daily labor with earthly things, whereby he must and shall seek his daily bread and the necessary means to maintain the office and the congregation among them.
