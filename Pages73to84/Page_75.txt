STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" / "Menigheden": carries ecclesial weight beyond "congregation"; denotes the gathered church as a corporate spiritual body.
* "Opgave og Pligt": task vs. duty—must preserve distinction between vocation and obligation.
* "Forkynde": preach/proclaim with biblical authority, not merely "teach" or "speak."
* "Embedsmand": office-holder; ecclesiastical office, not secular bureaucrat.
* "Kaldsgjerning": calling/vocation; divinely instituted office.
* "Skriftklog": biblically learned; echoes Matt. 13:52.
* "Kristi Brud": the Church as Bride of Christ; must retain nuptial ecclesiology.
* "Samvittighed": conscience; metaphorical, moral-spiritual register.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with layered clauses and semicolon logic.
* Analogical reasoning (state/property metaphor) that must remain intact.
* Accumulative role-descriptions of the minister—should not be broken down excessively.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between priesthood of all believers and the public ministry.
* Doctrine of vocation and divine calling.
* Preaching, sacraments, Word-centered ecclesiology.
* Sin, faith, conscience, and pastoral oversight.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, didactic Lutheran tone addressing ecclesial order.
* Warning against individualism and clerical isolation.
* Sermonic cadence that would be flattened by modern prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Forkynde Guds mangfoldige Visdom" (Eph. 3:10): direct biblical citation; KJV phrasing should be echoed.
* "Forkynde hans Dyder" (1 Pet. 2:9): biblical idiom—"show forth the praises" (KJV).
* Property/state analogy: culturally 19th-century but conceptually clear; must remain concrete.
* "Gammelt og nyt af sit Forraad": Matt. 13:52; KJV resonance essential.
* "Føre paa de rette Græsgange": Psalm 23 / John 10 shepherd imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Error arises from confusing the congregation’s task with the individual Christian’s task.
* Doctrinal distinction: Corporate vs. individual vocation.
* Analogy: Common vs. private property clarifies non-transferability.
* Application: The calling and role of the ordained teacher/pastor.
* Expansion: Detailed description of pastoral duties.
* Warning: Ministry cannot be isolated from active congregational life.
* Conclusion: Mutual vitality—pastor and congregation must live and work together.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ephesians 3:10 – God’s manifold wisdom proclaimed by the church.
* 1 Peter 2:9 – Believers called from darkness to light to proclaim God’s praises.
* Matthew 13:52 – The scribe instructed unto the kingdom bringing forth old and new.
* John 10 / Psalm 23 – Shepherd imagery.
* Pauline language: "all the counsel of God" (Acts 20:27).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness in defining boundaries of vocation.
* Preserve pastoral seriousness and ecclesial concern.
* Avoid sentimental or motivational softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" / "skal": must remain strong prohibitions and obligations.
* Vocational necessity must not be weakened into suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation / church (consistent choice within translation).
* Forkynde = proclaim/preach.
* Embede/Embedsmand = office / office-bearer.
* Kald = calling/vocation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Property/state analogy preserved fully.
* Shepherd, conscience, heart/body metaphors retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Didactic clarity → pastoral elevation → warning.
* Final image intensifies urgency rather than calming it.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorical force depends on accumulation.
* Clause rhythm preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The error in both of these opposing chains of reasoning lies in this, that they do not sharply distinguish between two different things: the task and duty of the congregation, and the task and duty of the individual Christian. It is the task of the whole congregation to proclaim the manifold wisdom of God (Eph. 3:10); it is the duty of each Christian to proclaim His praises, who hath called them out of darkness into His marvellous light. The individual cannot seize for himself the work of the congregation, and the congregation cannot deprive the individual of his work. If a state owns a common property, then no single man may take it as his own; but conversely, no state has the right to rob the individual of his property. What is common property we may entrust to an office-bearer to administer on our behalf; but what is our private property, that we each administer ourselves.

When, therefore, a congregation chooses a man made fit by the Lord to be its public teacher, he is thereby set apart for a particular calling; he becomes the congregation’s office-bearer, and it shall be his life’s task—and therefore also his means of livelihood—to be a preacher of the Gospel, a steward of the Sacraments, a servant of God, who without hindrance can devote himself to the study of God’s Word and to its dissemination. He shall daily penetrate into the whole counsel of God and become a true scribe, instructed for the kingdom of God, able to bring forth out of his treasure things old and new. He shall be an instrument of God to set forth from God’s Word Jesus, the crucified Saviour, the true constitution of Christ’s Bride, and the true nature of the individual Christian. He shall be the shepherd of the congregation, who leads it upon the right pastures; the watchman of the congregation, who by God’s Word fights against sin within it and deception round about it. He shall, so to speak, be the conscience of the congregation, in that by God’s Word he reproves sin and encourages faith, being an ever-living reminder of what the congregation is and of what a Christian is. Yet it is so far from the case that he should be the only one who lives and works in the congregation, that on the contrary there is great danger that he will not be what he ought to be if he becomes alone in life and labour. As a heart cannot beat the pulse of life in a dead body, so with great difficulty can a pastor be a true pastor, if his activity and labour do not give birth to activity and labour all around him.
