STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "rette Hyrder" — biblical-pastoral term; must echo shepherd imagery (John 10; Ezekiel 34).
* "kjødelige Bevæggrunde" — Pauline term ("fleshly motives"), not merely emotional or selfish.
* "Embedet" — the ordained pastoral office; must retain ecclesial weight.
* "Lægfolk / Lægprædikanter" — laity / lay preachers; avoid pejorative flattening.
* "Naadegaverne" — charismata; spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12), not generic talents.
* "Myndighed" — authority/standing; juridical-moral force.
* "Menighedsorden" — congregational order; ecclesial discipline.
* "Herskesyge" — domineering lust for power; strong moral term.
* "Opbyggelser" — edifying meetings; biblical term (edification).
* "Frie Forholde" — free church conditions/context; avoid political dilution.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, balanced clauses with concessive logic ("ligesom… saa… men dersom… saa heller ikke").
* Sermonic parallelism and antithesis.
* Imperative exhortations embedded mid-sentence.
* Final aphoristic rule ("Alt ske til Opbyggelse!").

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of ministry vs. priesthood of all believers.
* Abuse of office vs. abuse of freedom.
* Authority located in the congregation.
* Edification as regulative principle (1 Corinthians 14:26).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran free-church tone.
* Moral firmness without polemic excess.
* Direct appeal to conscience and communal responsibility.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "lægge Mundkurv paa" — idiom meaning to muzzle or silence; KJV resonance (1 Corinthians 9:9).
* "arbeide med Hænderne" — Pauline allusion (1 Thessalonians 4:11).
* "reise omkring" — itinerant preaching with suspicious motive.
* "vække Mistanke" — sow suspicion; rhetorical seriousness.
* "mandig Uafhængighed" — moral courage and independence, not masculinity per se.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Concession: abuses exist among both clergy and laity.
* Principle: abuse does not annul God-given order or freedom.
* Duty: cultivate gifts rightly before condemning misuse.
* Warning: dangers from unqualified clergy and irresponsible laity.
* Remedy: congregational life, freedom, godliness, cooperation.
* Conclusion: congregational authority bounded by edification.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Shepherd imagery — John 10; Ezekiel 34.
* Fleshly motives — Romans 8; Galatians 5.
* Gifts (charismata) — 1 Corinthians 12–14.
* Edification rule — 1 Corinthians 14:26.
* Working with hands — 1 Thessalonians 4:11; Acts 20:34.
* Muzzling — 1 Corinthians 9:9.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp warnings against tyranny and disorder.
* Preserve moral urgency without exaggeration.
* Maintain exhortational directness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "giver os ikke Ret" — categorical denial of right.
* "bør kunne" — moral necessity.
* Imperatives maintained as imperatives.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed — congregation.
* Embedet — the office.
* Opbyggelse — edification.
* Myndighed — authority.
* Naadegaver — gifts of grace / spiritual gifts.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shepherd vs. hireling implicit.
* Muzzling metaphor retained.
* Building/edification imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Balanced critique of clergy and laity.
* Severity in warnings; hope in remedy.
* Firm but conciliatory conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with semicolons.
* Maintain rhythmic antitheses.
* Final maxim stands alone.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It cannot, however, be concealed that just as there are pastors who are not true shepherds in the congregation, so there are also laymen who speak the Word of God from purely fleshly motives. Yet if the ungodliness of certain pastors does not give us the right to abolish the office itself, neither do the failings of certain lay preachers give us the right to forbid the free proclamation of the Word in the congregation by laymen. Let us do what we can to stir up the gifts of grace and to promote their right use; and when we have done what lies within our power for that cause, then by that very fact we have also gained the authority to reprove abuses. But he who does nothing to enable the congregation to build itself up and to labor and work in every direction for the spread of the kingdom of Christ—let him himself rather be silent than attempt to lay a muzzle upon others.

The Norwegian-American congregations are exposed to danger from persons who seek to press their way into the pastoral office without possessing even the most elementary qualifications for it. When such men enter the office, they are exceedingly prone to untimely lust for domination and to a desire to hinder all lay activity. On the other hand, there is danger from such laymen as, out of sloth or pride or for the sake of gain, will travel about and hold edifying meetings instead of working with their own hands. If these first gain some following, they will readily despise all congregational order and seek to awaken suspicion against the pastors wherever they go, perhaps in order to be chosen as pastors in the place of those who waver. Against both of these dangers there is one remedy: the life and freedom of the congregation. Earnest godliness and manly independence in the congregations, and a true, sincere cooperation between pastors and laymen—this is the safeguard against the disorders which bad pastors and bad lay preachers will bring about under our free conditions. It is a matter upon which we ought all to be able to agree in the Free Church, that the authority of the congregation ought to be able to set boundaries wherever it becomes necessary, both against the encroachments of the office and against the errors of the layman. But the rule of the congregation is this: Let all things be done unto edification!
