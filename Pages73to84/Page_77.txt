STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighedsmøder" – carries ecclesial and congregational governance connotations beyond mere meetings.
* "Opbyggelsesmøder" – pietistic term implying spiritual edification, not generic instruction.
* "Lægmandsvirksomhed" – denotes lay spiritual activity, with theological weight in Lutheran debates.
* "Aandens Gaver" – doctrinal term referring to gifts of the Holy Spirit.
* "Formaning" and "Belærelse" – exhortation and instruction with sermonic force.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extremely long sentences with layered subordinate clauses.
* Heavy use of semicolons and rhetorical accumulation.
* Conditional constructions that must not be flattened.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Pneumatology: operation of the Spirit through the congregation.
* Ecclesiology: definition of a "real" congregation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest polemical tone against clerical monopolization.
* Exhortational urgency.
* Rhetorical incredulity that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fri Menighed" – a free congregation, implying spiritual vitality and freedom from coercion.
* "finde Rum for Aandens Gaver" – metaphor of making room for the Spirit’s work.
* "Præstebud eller Politilove" – idiomatic pairing expressing ecclesial and civil repression.
* Clear resonance with Acts and early church practice.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Assertion of necessity of congregational and edification meetings.
* Distinction between lay activity and clerical dominance.
* Historical-theological argument from early Christianity and church history.
* Moral exhortation and evaluative conclusion.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 2:42–47 – early Christian gatherings.
* 1 Corinthians 14 – mutual edification and gifts of the Spirit.
* Hebrews 10:24–25 – exhorting one another.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical sharpness toward resistant clergy.
* Preserve admiration for persecuted believers.
* Maintain rhetorical wonder and moral judgment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke", "maa", "er nødvendigt" must retain full necessity and impossibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Aandens Gaver – gifts of the Spirit
* Opbyggelse – edification
* Formaning – exhortation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Spatial metaphors of room, gathering, finding place.
* Historical imagery of persecution and witness.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between joy over faithful congregations and lament over barren ones.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long-period sentences suitable for proclamation.
* Maintain rhythmic escalation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

We cannot, however, refrain from mentioning that both congregational meetings for the governance of the congregation and edification meetings for the congregation’s growth in faith are so natural and regular a form of the exercise of the gifts that it is exceedingly difficult to conceive of a free congregation without them. That congregational meetings are essentially a work of laypeople admits of little doubt, even though there are many congregations in America where the congregational meetings as well are only a form of the pastor’s sole activity. Yet congregational meetings have of themselves become unavoidable everywhere.

Edification meetings, in which laypeople both pray and exhort, on the other hand seem to be the object of bitter hatred on the part of many pastors. And yet it is utterly incomprehensible how anyone can find room for the gifts of the Spirit without such gatherings being held. Whether the pastor is present or not; yes, even if the pastor is opposed to them, it nevertheless appears altogether necessary for a true congregation to seek to employ all its powers in this way as well.

It is at any rate certain that the gatherings of the first Christians were essentially of this character, and it is a known fact that at all times in the history of the Church, whenever there has been any spiritual life, the need for these gatherings has been so strong that neither clerical prohibitions nor police laws have been able to prevent them. From such gatherings the Lord’s witnesses have been brought forth before tyrannical judges and have been banished from the land and cast into prison and slain; and yet again and again the people of God have always found time and place to assemble for the purpose of praying with one another and for one another, and of being strengthened by brotherly exhortation and instruction.

Strange indeed would it be if Christian people, when they assemble, should not be permitted to assemble around God’s Word and converse with one another and instruct one another concerning the wondrous works of the Lord! We must therefore rejoice with joy over every congregation where such gatherings are held, and we must grieve and lament over every assembly of people that calls itself a congregation and yet has no gift of the Spirit which it can in this manner employ for its own edification.
