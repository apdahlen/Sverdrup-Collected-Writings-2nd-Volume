STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Diakonembedet / Diakonatet" – carries ecclesial and biblical weight; must not be reduced to generic "charity work" or modern NGO-style service.
* "Menighed / Menigheder" – congregation(s) in a theological sense, not merely social groups.
* "Frikirke / Frimenighed" – free church context, historically specific, not simply "independent church" in a modern sense.
* "Gjerning" – work or ministry; more than task or activity, implies vocation and service before God.
* "Erkjendelse" – confession/recognition with moral and spiritual depth, not mere awareness.
* "Gave" – spiritual gift (charisma), not talent in a secular sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with layered subordinate clauses that create sermonic flow.
* Logical pivots introduced by "dog," "men," and "derfor" must be preserved.
* Balanced contrasts (hidden faithfulness vs. public deficiency) must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Understanding of office (embede) as divinely ordered within the congregation.
* Sin, imperfection, and confession applied corporately to the church.
* Concept of God-given gifts and divine calling.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Risk of flattening exhortation into neutral description.
* Danger of softening critique of congregational failure.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "trængt ind i den kirkelige Bevidsthed" – metaphor of penetration into consciousness; should remain vivid.
* "i det skjulte og for Gud" – echoes Matthew 6; service rendered unseen before God.
* "klæber ved" – image of something that clings; moral imperfection adhering to earthly church life.
* "fremelskede" – organic metaphor of cultivation and growth.
  KJV Resonance:
* "before God," "faithful," "service," "office," "blessing" all align naturally with KJV diction.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Transitional thesis: one cannot speak of church federation without first addressing the diaconate.
* Assertion of importance and widespread intuitive recognition of the office.
* Lament over lack of reflection and clarity regarding its function.
* Contrast between hidden faithfulness and public inadequacy.
* Deeper diagnosis: not mere general imperfection, but lack of understanding of the office itself.
* Historical explanation for this lack.
* Concluding purpose: justification for offering instruction.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "i det skjulte og for Gud" – Matthew 6:3–4.
* Corporate confession of imperfection – 1 John 1:8 applied ecclesially.
* Gifts given by the Lord – Romans 12; 1 Corinthians 12.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain seriousness when speaking of sin and deficiency.
* Preserve earnest pastoral concern rather than academic detachment.
* Avoid euphemisms for failure or neglect.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "umuligt" must remain absolute ("impossible").
* "maa" and "kan" constructions preserved as necessity and inability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Embede = office
* Gjerning = work / ministry (consistently)
* Gave = gift
* Menighed = congregation
* Velsignelse = blessing

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Organic metaphors (growth, cultivation, clinging imperfection) retained.
* Spatial metaphors (place of the office) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between gratitude for faithfulness and rebuke for neglect.
* Balance of humility and exhortation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorical weight depends on them.
* Semicolon logic retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Diaconal Office in the Congregation

It is impossible for us to pass from speaking of the individual local congregation in the Free Church to speaking of the association of congregations within a fellowship, without first treating separately of an exceedingly important office in the congregation, namely, the diaconate. It has already so pressed itself into our ecclesiastical consciousness that we can scarcely imagine a free congregation as organized if it does not have its deacons. Yet hitherto so little has been written concerning this ministry, and so few clarifying accounts have been provided as to how it is exercised in the various congregations and within the different fellowships, that one must generally be content with the brief and dry legal provisions in the congregational constitutions when one seeks to form a conception of the place the deacons truly occupy in our congregations. Certain it is, however, that on the one hand, in many a congregation in America, much faithful diaconal service is rendered in secret and before God, while on the other hand the diaconate in many places only very imperfectly fills the place it ought to have.

It belongs to the Christian congregation’s confession of sin that it both knows and feels with pain that it is imperfect in all its work; but when we must especially emphasize that there is often much lacking in the care with which the work of the diaconate is carried out, we mean thereby more than that imperfection which clings to all the congregation’s work on earth. There is, to be sure, often lacking the proper understanding of what the work of the deacons truly is, both among the congregations who elect, and among the men who are elected to this office. Therefore those men are not always chosen to whom the Lord has given the gift to carry out this service; neither can the gifts rightly be developed, trained, and cultivated where there is lacking a clear and thorough insight into the true significance of the ministry. In part this has its cause in the fact that this office is not known from the church of the homeland, nor has it been taken up again through an independent development within Norwegian congregations, but must rather be regarded as transferred from American congregations to ours. It may therefore be of some benefit to attempt to provide certain explanations of what this office is, and how it may best become a blessing to congregational life.
