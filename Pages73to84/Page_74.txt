STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frimenigheder" – historically specific free congregations, not generic "free churches."
* "Embedet" – ecclesiastical office, especially the pastoral ministry, not mere employment.
* "Forkyndelse" – proclamation/preaching with authoritative, biblical force.
* "Menighedsorden" – church order grounded in Scripture, not administrative bylaws.
* "Lægmandsvirksomheden" – lay activity/ministry, often polemically charged.
* "Enebesidder" – sole possessor; strong juridical sense.
* "ministerielle Forretninger" – ministerial acts/duties, not bureaucratic tasks.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, carefully balanced sentences with logical chains and rhetorical quotation.
* Parallel presentation of two opposing syllogisms.
* Embedded biblical quotations that must retain cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Distinction between general Christian calling and the particular pastoral office.
* Rightful preaching of the Word and administration of sacraments.
* Abuse either of clerical monopoly or congregational anarchy.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical, Lutheran sermonic tone.
* Address to conscience and church order.
* Danger of flattening argument into neutral prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Tyv og en Røver" – clear echo of John 10; must retain biblical sharpness.
* "herske over Herrens Hjord" – echoes 1 Peter 5; warning against domination.
* "lære og paaminde hverandre" – Colossians 3:16; mutual exhortation.
* "kaldt til at forkynde Herrens Dyder" – 1 Peter 2:9; priesthood language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: context of free congregations governed by Scripture, not custom.
* Central concern: mutual limitation of office and free proclamation.
* Presentation of two opposing logical arguments.
* Critique: both appear sound but contradict Scripture.
* Final doctrinal correction affirming both communal exhortation and distinct office.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 10:1 – "thief and robber."
* Colossians 3:16 – teaching and admonishing one another.
* Ephesians 4:11 – Christ appointing apostles, teachers.
* 1 Corinthians 9:14 – those who preach the gospel living by the gospel.
* 1 Peter 2:9; 5:2–3 – priesthood and shepherding language.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical clarity.
* No softening of warnings against misuse of office or false freedom.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and prohibition: "it is against God's Word," "must," "cannot."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Embedet" = the Office.
* "Forkyndelse" = proclamation/preaching.
* "Menigheden" = the congregation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Shepherd/flock imagery.
* Legal metaphors of right and possession.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Analytical exposition followed by sharp doctrinal judgment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences and rhetorical balance.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Here, then, in our Free Congregations—where not ancient custom and usage alone may decide what is right, but where the Word of God must ever anew be the foundation of our congregational order—here it comes above all to lay the most earnest weight upon both these matters. What we must rightly give heed to is this: that the Office does not hinder the free proclamation of the Word, and that the free proclamation does not usurp the work of the Office.

There is a logical chain of reasoning which will always be brought forward against lay activity in the Free Congregation. It runs thus: “The congregation has the right to proclaim the Word and to administer the Sacraments. Since not all can exercise this right, it is entrusted to a single man (the pastor) by the congregation’s election. Thereby the one elected becomes the sole possessor of the right, and therefore no other may either preach or administer the Sacraments. Whoever preaches or teaches, apart from the pastor, is therefore a thief and a robber.” There is another chain of reasoning, no less logical, which will always be used to annihilate the distinctive position of the Office in the congregation. It is this: “God’s people are a people of priests, called to proclaim the virtues of the Lord; since no one can take this calling away from God’s people, the election of a pastor is no transfer of proclamation to a single man; but when one is chosen in particular, it is only that he may be ready to preach when necessity does not fall upon any other, and for the sake of order he should perform the ‘ministerial acts.’ Therefore, if the pastor preaches and teaches in the congregation as one who has the right and duty thereto continually and as a daily calling, then he is one of those who would lord it over the Lord’s flock.”

Both of these chains of reasoning appear excellent, and yet they both end by coming into conflict with the Word of God. It is against God’s Word that a single man alone should wholly possess the right to bear witness and to teach in a congregation; for where then is the exhortation that Christians should “teach and admonish one another”? It is against God’s Word that the one who is chosen as teacher in the congregation should not thereby have received a particular calling which the other members of the congregation do not have; for where then is the Word of God that Christ appointed some as apostles, and so forth; and the commandment “that they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel”?
